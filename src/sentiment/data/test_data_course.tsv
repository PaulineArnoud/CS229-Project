0	This class is a very good basic Python course. They provide you with a ton of resources to help you out too (discussion board, discussion section, OH, tons of practice problems)	CS-106A
0	The instructor and the TA team are very friendly, professional, and willing to help. Reach out to the numerous resources that this course offers and ask a lot of questions, even though some questions may seem minor. I had some coding experience before this course, but I still found this course very helpful for building a stronger foundation in coding and also learning the logic behind coding, which really trains your brain. Start the homework early and ask questions during IGs. Although the lectures were recorded, I found going to in-person lectures helped me set up a strict schedule of studying for this course.	CS-106A
0	CS106A is an excellent class. Nick did a very good job of going over the course materials in a comprehensive way. The TAs are also very good in sections. You can't go to office hours with your specific TA, but you get individual feedback from your TA during IGs. It's never necessary to go to class in person because it's all recorded/streamed live. The assignments were well-paced and if you understand the practice questions for the midterm/final, you'll be fine (the test questions are very similar).	CS-106A
0	It was a great class. One of my worries was that it would be difficult to catch on since I didn't have any experience with CS before taking this class but the way lectures are taught and the way sections are led make it very accessible. It's also really convenient to be able to have the option to watch lecture recordings rather than having to go in person. This was extremely helpful, but I would recommend making yourself go to lecture if you think you'll procrastinate watching the recordings.	CS-106A
0	Great starter for coding - get your feet wet and find out if coding is for you	CS-106A
0	Very good class. I would highly recommend it. The PSets are very doable with all the resources the class offers, and are appropriately difficult.	CS-106A
0	It is a must-take for any Stanford student! If you can fit it in your schedule comfortably, take it.	CS-106A
0	Great course highly recommend	CS-106A
0	The class content is super fast-paced which can be stressful to keep up. Tip that helped me was watching lecture on video in live time and pausing when I needed more time to process or read the lecture notes. Professor Parlante teaches quite fast and sometimes when dealing with such intricate content, you need to take more time to absorb it.	CS-106A
0	I would say there was often a gap between the lecture material and the assignments. The directions to the assignments were also often inadequate. I would say this class requires outside help with things like the LAIR or other tutoring options.	CS-106A
0	Great introduction into computer science and python coding! The teaching staff really knows what they are doing and everything is very routine. If you put time into learning the basics the class isn't hard to do well in.	CS-106A
0	Nick Parlante is funny and a great and engaging teacher	CS-106A
0	Nick is a great lecturer, better than most professors.	CS-106A
0	Highly recommend.  Professor Parlante is excellent!	CS-106A
0	Take the course! I learned so much and had a lot of fun. I had no prior coding experience, so I was nervous, but it's super accessible and well organized	CS-106A
0	Go to class and section.	CS-106A
0	Absolutely a must-take course for every student at Stanford.	CS-106A
0	"This class has a steep learning curve at first but if you study a good deal for the midterm, it should ""click"" for you eventually and the rest of the assignments should get easier."	CS-106A
0	It is a heavy work load but super fun and interesting, make sure you take it with other classes that are going to be easier, try not to combine CS106A with other STEM's.	CS-106A
0	As somebody who has never coded before, it was a tough introduction. I thought it was going to be easier than it was, and it was definitely hard seeing people with coding experience get the hang of it so quickly. At the end of the day, I think I am glad that I took it and got a basic understanding of coding, but be prepared to put in many hours if this is your first time learning cs.	CS-106A
0	Nick Parlante is a great teacher who really helps you understand the material. The class feels like a very good pace E slow enough that you're absorbing the info but also fast enough to go over a lot. The homework assignments are a good degree of challenging but definelty not overwhelming. Loved the class overall.	CS-106A
0	There's a big learning curve.	CS-106A
0	TAKE IT!!!!	CS-106A
0	You have to take this course if you're a Stanford student. Very well-taught and not overly rigorous. One of the few classes that I would honestly describe as pretty fun.	CS-106A
0	It's a lot of fun! Highly recommended	CS-106A
0	This course is great for those new to coding. It is perhaps the best taught entry course at Stanford and very reasonable with tests. The homework is difficult so don't wait till the last minute to start assignments. Also, use LaIR to its full advantage, the students working there are so helpful.	CS-106A
0	I would HIGHLY recommend that a student take this course. It has been my favorite class at Stanford thus far. If you do not know programming, that is okay. This class will help you. While this class can be challenging at times, there are so many wonderful resources at your disposal including TA's, office hours, LAIR, and other advanced CS students in the dorm.	CS-106A
0	Yes, I think CS is becoming more and more relevant in every single field, and this course does a great job of demonstrating a variety of applications while also being very beginner friendly!	CS-106A
0	This course is extremely organized, well-taught, and run by an incredible and supportive teaching team. All the resources are there; you just have to be willing to utilize them and really put in the time and effort, especially if you've never coded before.	CS-106A
0	This class is fun but can be challenging at times; it is helpful to make use of office hours or other resources.	CS-106A
0	Definitely take it!	CS-106A
0	Take this course if you are a STEM major as the world is evolving to become more tech savvy it is nice to have a basic understanding of coding even if you don't continue past 106A. Plus, Nick is AMAZING professor, he is also very adorable with his little commentary. #106Awoohoo	CS-106A
0	This course is well-taught, and you'll learn a lot of Python. I actually looked forward to doing the homework, especially since I like problem solving. I was nervous when the said the pace was fast, but I didn't think it was any faster than my other courses. Highly recommend!	CS-106A
0	It's not too bad if you do the work - coming from someone who has never coded before!	CS-106A
0	This class is an excellent introduction to coding. The pace is quick, but pretty easy to stay on top of. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the field of computer science.	CS-106A
0	It is very fast in the beginning and watching lectures is important.	CS-106A
0	Easy intro-level course, attendance not required to get a good grade and a solid foundation in Python	CS-106A
0	I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in programming or dipping their toes into the realm of CS. It's incredibly well-taught and will challenge you in very insightful ways.	CS-106A
0	Definitely take this class if you have any interest in CS or exploring quantitative skills. The class is very well taught and the assignments are engaging and interesting. I also think it offers an intro to both coding and data science which is helpful for people who are interested in STEM and also applying quantitative skills to the humanities.	CS-106A
0	Its Stanford, you should take at least one CS course while you're here. If you've never coded before like me then this is a good course to take	CS-106A
0	ItEs a great introduction to CS and coding.	CS-106A
0	This is probably the most well-taught and easy to follow CS class at Stanford. The amount you put into the class is the amount you will get out of it. There is an option to watch the lectures online but I personally think that it is better to take the class in-person because you will retain more knowledge. Make use of the Lair office hours if you are genuinely struggling to debug a code. They WILL help you. That is all I have to say, but this class is definitely worth taking in your time at Stanford. No prior knowledge is necessary.	CS-106A
0	Doing the practice problems in lecture is very helpful, and make sure you can write code from scratch before the midterm and final. Do a lot of practice problems! This class was my first exposure to coding- and I can see how it hooks so many students. Very fun!	CS-106A
0	If you've never coded before and you're taking a heavy course load, I would say it might be a bit more difficult than what people generally say.	CS-106A
0	This is a must take class here at Stanford. It it challenging but fun at the same time. You will learn a lot and who knows it could be something you want to pursue.	CS-106A
0	I think this is a great course to take, it's not too difficult, and the professor and TAs want you to do well. It provides good, surface level information that will give you foundational knowledge of coding logic. I think it's good information to have even if you are not planning to major in computer science or STEM at all.	CS-106A
0	Such a fantastic class, no matter what you want to study, you should probably take this course. Pedagogically impeccable and so much fun.	CS-106A
1	Take it as a beginner course to get the hang of C++, and popular algorithms.	CS-106B
1	Do it! Although the course might be more challenging with Keith teaching it, you learn so much more than in other quarters!	CS-106B
1	Keith is a fantastic teacher. His class is difficult but he lectures well and you learn a huge amount.	CS-106B
1	"Though I heard many people say ""don't take 106B with Keith, he makes it so much harder,"" I didn't really think it could be that bad. It was that bad. I came from 106A, where I felt very confident in my abilities to approach each problem with a clear understanding of how to do it. This changed dramatically in 106B. I went from understanding how to do every problem to not even knowing how to approach them. This is mostly because the content of lectures is dramatically different from the material tested in the psets. Keith shows clear, simple cases of code in class, and then expects you to make a massive jump in reasoning to accomplish the psets. Obviously, I don't have another frame of reference for other instructors, but I'm just warning you, if you don't have to take 106B with Keith, DON'T. Preserve your mental health and take it a different quarter with a more chill instructor. Keith is a great lecturer, but his tests and psets made me question my abilities every single week."	CS-106B
1	"This course is incredible. The work that the teaching team puts into the assignments in terms of the testing and running of the programs you write is staggering. You can feel how you are benefitting from years of hard work on their part. The lectures are a good source of interesting information and you may be able to refer back  to the material covered at times during assignments. For example, when you get to class design or the algorithms necessary to complete hash tables or heaps, you will need the lecture material to complete that work. However, I would form a strategy early for solving problems that have loose grounding in the lecture material or reading covered. If you come from 106A, with little other programming experience, I would begin completing extra textbook exercises or past exam problems ASAP, especially with recursion, or the midterm and final may surprise you in its approach to assessment. This course takes the coding interview approach to assessment, where you are assessed based on your ability to work through a new problem and if you are not used to working this skill you may need time to adjust. In other words, getting a ""check-plus"" on every assignment  may not necessarily translate to a strong performance on the assessments, depending on your background; the assignments are more about following a procedure with well written and documented assignment handouts with small windows for novel problem solving. If you come from a Mathematics or prior programming background assessments may be fun, but I did not. It just meant that I needed some extra practice with this new way of thinking and approaching problems. After putting some extra time in, I benefitted greatly and came out a much stronger student."	CS-106B
1	If you don't feel too confident from 106A, don't take it. This class was really difficult for me and definitely wore me down and ruined my quarter. There's a huge amount of support and resources but it always felt like if you don't know how to apply the code right away, you're just left behind. Also, they changed the final format, to a 6 hour take-home, instead of a 72 hour take-home, after the C/NC | withdraw deadline, which isn't great considering I would've made it C/NC if they announced it prior. Also, there's a huge dissonance between the great lectures, and the difficulty of the hw. I, among others who only had coding experience from 106A, definitely felt left behind by the teaching staff and experienced coders. Also, them moving LAIR to in-person, to me, felt pre-meditated so less students utilize LAIR.	CS-106B
1	If you are not confident with programming, by the end of this course if you put in the work and ask for help when you need it, you will find that you can utilize programming in new ways!	CS-106B
1	"Don't take this class with Keith! You will greatly regret it. While he is upbeat and attempts to be engaging in lectures, the topics and practice problems we cover in lecture are nowhere near the difficulty of the p-sets or exams. Speaking of the assignments with friends who took it with other instructors, their final question on their p-sets were oftentimes our warmup questions. It often feels like Keith and the staff are just throwing you into the water with very little support, with Lair completely filling up before its official start time several times this quarter. If nearly 1/3 of the class is asking for help debugging, it likely means that there's something wrong with course design or the way it is taught. A lot of lecture is spent covering very simple examples or concepts and the homework often involves techniques, containers, or styles that we've never seen in class before and we're just left to ""have fun and figure it out"". Little efforts have been made to improve these aspects despite multiple student complaints. The staff's solution to increasing accessibility to Lair was to make it in person only, making it more difficult for students to get help, and make the final exam a 6 hour timed exam (informed us of this decision after the withdrawal deadline) while maintaining that the exam is only designed to take us three hours (the same was said of the midterm, and everyone I spoke to spent at least 10~15 hours on it). Overall, bad communication, unnecessarily difficult, and no real reason to take it with Keith when you can have an easier time another quarter and not destroy your mental health every week."	CS-106B
1	Keith is an excellent and energetic instructor. The assignments are very clearly laid out so that you can best organize your thinking process to successfully implement the code. Communicating with the teaching team is easy and there is ample support to answer any questions. That said, expect this to be one of your more demanding courses as the assignments can be deceptively simple, and if you don't plan your time wisely you may find yourself unexpectedly dedicating more hours than anticipated to finishing your work.	CS-106B
1	Do not take it with Keith, the assignments are way too hard for no reason. The other professors are much better	CS-106B
1	A very good introductory Data Structures and Algorithms course to get started off in Computer Science.	CS-106B
1	Take this course!!! Especially with Keith if you can. The quality of instruction is unbelievable, and the content is extremely applicable for anyone, no matter your major or degree program.	CS-106B
1	Watch out. This could tank your quarter or your GPA if you aren't prepared to use all the available resources. LAIR and edStem are your friends. You will need them. This ISN'T like 106a.Also, don't come in expecting a whole lot of real-world examples that *don't* have to do with computational theory... Which is pretty fun, but maybe not quite what I was expecting to learn.Honestly, I would still take it again though.	CS-106B
1	This is an amazing course!!! It can be tough, but it's really fun and you'll be amazed by how much you learn. The content you learn here can be applied towards pretty much any field of study, including outside of regular stem majors. The teaching team is wonderful and Keith is an incredible lecturer. As somebody who usually has trouble focusing during lectures, every class was engaging and exciting. I think that everybody with a bit of time to put in should take it.	CS-106B
1	CS 106B is worth your while, and Keith is an excellent lecturer. I recommend taking it, even if you don't plan to pursue CS.	CS-106B
1	Take this class if you want to take a deeper dive into coding and C++. It is definitely challenging but you leave the course feeling like you actually know how to code.	CS-106B
1	It is very hard and time consuming	CS-106B
1	Absolutely take it, and take it Winter quarter with no other PSET classes. It's the same case as 106A where you get out what you put into it, and the instruction is really phenomenal. It might kick your ass really hard, which is why I say take it with a light course load aside from 106B, but it really is a treat. Should you decide to stop CS after this class, you would still be well enough equipped to use your skills later on in your career, pre or post graduation. TAKE THE CLASS!!! (And if you liked Nick you will love Keith)	CS-106B
1	106B is a bit more challenging than 106A however I feel like the material is more enjoyable than 106A. If given the chance I would strongly recommend taking it with Keith	CS-106B
1	As someone who had only programmed in 106A, this course was difficult but doable. Keith is an excellent lecturer, and his psets are difficult, but you learn a lot.	CS-106B
1	Make sure you go to or at least watch all the lectures and start the assignments early. Section problems are super applicable to assignment and test problems, so don't miss. Also, make use of your section leader for help.	CS-106B
1	you should DEFINITELY take this class. it doesn't matter what you're majoring in, this class will teach you so many skills that can be applied to a vast number of fields. Keith was an amazing teacher and an amazing lecturer. His passion for CS will make you genuinely excited about the subject and the assignments are designed to make you master the material and feel like you're learning through them.	CS-106B
1	It is a good class.	CS-106B
1	Pay attention in lecture	CS-106B
1	I personally thought that this class was really well taught and that Keith is a great lecturer. I felt that I learned a lot although sometimes the class takes up a bit of time.	CS-106B
1	This class is really fun if you like problem solving. Try to place yourself in a section with friends because I didnEt and it made some of the assignments more difficult (but still manageable)!	CS-106B
1	TAKE THIS - it's an amazing class. But make space for it. Taking it in the Winter with Math 51 was not terrible terrible like everyone says, but not a great time either. You will have to stay on top of things, which is quite hard. But the process will be rewarding!! Keith was amazing, and the course staff were so helpful.	CS-106B
1	Great! The assignments take up a lot of time but teach a lot too	CS-106B
1	Be sure to communicate any struggles early and utilize the help offered now. The course is good for learning how to solve complex problems. Start on the assignments early and take your time working on them consistently.	CS-106B
1	Very well-taught class with a wide range of skills and concepts that might seem unconnected until the end of the course. Assignments take an extremely long time to complete; this is both a pro and a con because you really learn about the topics at hand, but it leaves less time to really sit with the material and have additional time to study for the exams.	CS-106B
1	This class will give you a lot of experience in coding practice and teach you a lot about algorithms and different problem solving approaches. The material is generally laid out to be very accessible. Sometimes, the problem sets required a lot more effort than you were expecting, but there are resources available to you if you know where to look.	CS-106B
1	Give yourself enough time for the assignments and catchup on lectures well before you need to start them	CS-106B
1	Take it! Keith is an amazing lecturer! He has a special way of engaging with his students and helped me gain an extremely strong foundation of computer science. You will finish class feeling much more confident about your computer science knowledge and skills.	CS-106B
1	Make sure you are mentally prepared to take this course!	CS-106B
1	This class was a lot of content for quarter and very fast paced but it is a good challenge if you want a very solid foundation in programming.	CS-106B
1	Incredible support from faculty	CS-106B
1	If you can, follow the schedule for the assignments as they are laid out for you, it is useful to have ample opportunities to ask for help during the assignments.	CS-106B
1	This course is difficult and will take a substantial amount of your time (at least 2-3 hours daily including weekends). There is a ton of learning too on many concepts such as containers, recursion, and hashing. It all depends on what you want out of the class so think wisely before enrolling.	CS-106B
1	This class was fun, but also challenging at times. At the beginning, I felt that the class was super manageable (< 5 hours for each assignment), and I really enjoyed working through the assignments. During week 3 or week 4, the assignments became significantly more challenging, and I had to devout a LOT of time to working on the assignments (12+ hours on a single assignment). The assignments became more manageable toward the end of the quarter. The assignments and midterm exam require intuition beyond what you learn in class, which is why they can be a bit challenging at times. However, the instructor is great at explaining concepts, and there is almost always help available to you.	CS-106B
1	I really liked CS 106B. Yes, it is a time consuming class but Keith was an amazing lecturer and I truly feel like a better coder after this quarter.	CS-106B
1	Very good course although the homeworks can be quite heavy	CS-106B
1	This course is a core, foundational piece of the puzzle for anyone interested in computer science, so it is a must-take. Keith is an excellent lecturer, and makes the concepts easy to digest/understand. The assigmments really help make the concepts concrete as well.	CS-106B
1	Keith's class is hard. He is a great lecturer but his assignments are just too hard and stressful. The step up from 106A to 106B is bigger than the step from no coding to 106A, so be careful. With that said, you learn a ton; if I went back, I wouldnEt take it with Keith if I had the choice. But again, I learned a lot from Keith.	CS-106B
1	Recursion is not a big bad wolf.	CS-106B
2	Andrew is an incredibly thoughtful, intelligent, and kind instructor. Take it for access to him!	CS-107
2	andrew is amaaazing , definitely take it if you feel unconfident in the class material!	CS-107
2	Andrew is such a wonderful, available, kind teacher! He makes himself so available to students and works so hard to make 107a enjoyable and informative. I'm so glad I did 107a, because without it, the class would've felt infinitely more difficult.	CS-107
2	I can't possibly recommend 107E with Pat and Julie more. They are sublime teachers with a wealth of knowledge and they are both amazing teachers and wonderful people. You will be pushed hard in this class, but it will feel so rewarding and you will learn so much that you would be foolish to pass up the opportunity to learn in this intimate environment. Take this class, take this class, take this class!	CS-107
2	Take this class, but if you aren't a top tier hacker, make it your only difficult class. I took it with CS109, an intro-sem, and a PE class, and I definitely struggled to balance my time between classes. This class was my favorite class, but my grade in CS109 definitely suffered due to my inability to walk away from my CS107E projects and equally distribute my attention. You will not want to stop working on these assignments. They are challenging but soo satisfying.	CS-107
2	I learned so much from this class and feel much more confident in my ability to write clean, functional and modular code. Lecture is super entertaining. Pat and Julie make lecture just the absolute best!! Aside from learning about memory, peripherals and program execution from the ground up you also get exposed to and have to learn how to use many new tools such as git, vim, GDB and the command line. Its a steep learning curve for sure and the third and fourth assignment are definitely quite challenging and tedious, however, you walk away form this class having learned so much and feeling really proud and satisfied that you actually built a computer form the ground up. If you have time you should definitely take this class!!!	CS-107
2	If you want to feel confident about how a computer works and how to use all manner of sensors and hardware, this is the course for you. Make sure you plan on allotting quite a bit of time for this course! It will be the main event of your term.	CS-107
2	This class is quite hard and time-consuming, but also incredibly rewarding. If you are open to challenging yourself for the sake of your learning and growth, I highly encourage the course. The content is difficult but the TAs and instructions are all incredibly dedicated to making sure all students succeed.	CS-107
2	I would not recommend taking this course in a heavy quarter. Be prepared to spend time exceeding 5 units of work for this class.	CS-107
2	Please take the class with a friend. it can be very isolating sometime if you don't know anyone in the course.	CS-107
2	I definitely did not know how much work it was going to be. I wish someone had told me or that the staff had been more up front about it in the beginning. Personally, I loved the class, but given that many of my friends are graduating this spring and this was my last quarter with them (I'm studying abroad in the spring), it ate into social time that I will never get back. I would not have taken this class this quarter if there was more upfront warnings about the load.	CS-107
2	This course is super fun and will give you a great community of people, but understand that part of that community is formed through shared struggle. The instructors Pat and Julie are absolutely amazing and so are the TA's but the fact is that this is just a really hard course. Plan on this course taking up the majority of your time debugging, and trying to understand the lectures and things. GO TO OFFICE HOURS and do not, I repeat, DO NOT take this class with a bunch of other time consuming classes (taking CS107E, PWR and a high level math for only 14 units may seem like a good idea but you will soon regret it).	CS-107
2	I can't possibly recommend 107E with Pat and Julie more. They are sublime teachers with a wealth of knowledge and they are both amazing teachers and wonderful people. You will be pushed hard in this class, but it will feel so rewarding and you will learn so much that you would be foolish to pass up the opportunity to learn in this intimate environment. Take this class, take this class, take this class!	CS-107
2	This course is a great learning experience and I highly recommend it, especially if you don't have any experience with computer hardware or systems. One thing to note is that it can be quite intensive during the middle part of the quarter, so make sure to plan accordingly. The assignments are very interesting and by the end you'll have a complete suite of functionality that you can take pride in having made yourself.	CS-107
2	This course can be very tough if you are not comfortable with pointers, C, or computer logic/arithmetic. If you are familiar with these concepts, the core assignments are not that difficult but some of the extensions can take time and effort (which you will need if you want an A). The teaching is generally solid and the staff was very helpful in responding to issues or providing general help. The final project can be really daunting, even for someone who did not have any real trouble with the assignments, but the course overall is quite enjoyable and interesting and I would recommend it over 107.	CS-107
2	This class is incredible!! ItEs challenging but so rewarding. ItEs one of the most engaging cs classes- everything assignment you do has a clear purpose and tangible results. It can be but its so fulfilling, and Pat and Julie are phenomenal lecturers. The tas are amazing and so available to help. Take it, you wonEt regret it.	CS-107
2	Amazing class, it's a lot of work but you end building a computer from the ground up so it's SUPER COOL	CS-107
2	While challenging, this course is very helpful. While I previously have not had intentions of exploring systems, taking 107 has exposed me to a whole new level of abstraction that I never thought about.	CS-107
2	Start the projects really really early, they can take much longer than you might think, and sometimes one bug can take 90% of your time.	CS-107
2	Budget A LOT of time for this class at the end of the quarter. It begins rather manageable and ramps up significantly the last three weeks. If you are not a very good time manager or a fairly advanced programmer, this course is not well suited to be taken simultaneously with other time-consuming classes. The tests are fairly challenging as well since you don't have much time to prepare in between assignments. Particularly for the final there is an very quick turnaround between the due date for the final project which takes 40-50 hours on average and the final exam, so make sure to study throughout the quarter. Despite this, you learn a lot and completing the course is very rewarding. There is a lot of support available (though not as much as 106) and it's great to utilize those resources early.	CS-107
2	Really amazing class! I found the assignments and lectures to be very insightful and one of the biggest takeaways from the class for me is understanding how vulnerabilities in programs can arise. With the knowledge of low level programming, I can now understand how basic hacking techniques work. I also truly believe that Chris Gregg is a very thoughtful instructor that made it a point to address and prioritize student's mental health, which I really appreciated. The fact that he was always so open to communicating with students showed that he really cared about us. I think the assignments can be hard which is why Chris always recommends to start early but sometimes that's not possible (as I have personally experienced). I would say in that case don't panic, just break the problem down into smaller pieces, and if you are stuck on a part, you can always post a question on Ed (after first checking to see if the same question has been asked before of course).	CS-107
2	Stay on top of your work and get started on assignments early because they can take a lot of time unexpectedly. As long as you keep up, you should be fine.	CS-107
2	This is a very hard course, the last two assignments are like full time jobs. Start very early on all assigns and get help from the TA's who will be very useful. Use the course reader too it is good.	CS-107
2	Take it an easy quarter	CS-107
2	Great course to learn whether you like systems or not. Binary Bomb and Heap Allocator take a lot of time - make sure you start on them early!	CS-107
2	a lot of work	CS-107
2	Last two assignments (SecureVault and Heap Allocator) are more time-consuming than the previous ones, so be aware of that when planning out your workload for the quarter. Get started on the assignments as early as possible. Even just reading the assignment handouts is a good start, since they take a nontrivial amount of time to read through. Challenging course, but definitely manageable, and you learn a lot! Completing assignments is quite rewarding as well. You will be a better coder after 107, compared to after only 106B.	CS-107
2	People talk about 107 in a daunting way, but the truth is that it is a manageable class if you are willing to put in the work, struggle a little bit, and stay on top of lectures and assignments. Chris is incredibly thoughtful about the way he teaches and genuinely wants what is best for students. I would suggest taking this right after 106B. For me personally, I struggled a lot more than average in 106 and was hesitant to take this course, but I found that it wasn't an unmanageable step up. If anything, the people who had to work harder in the 106 series are used to spending more time on assignments and taking extra steps to solidify understanding - two skills that are crucial in this class.	CS-107
2	This is a class in which you'll learn a lot. The last 2 assignments are much longer than all prior ones, so make sure to plan in advance, but they are also the ones where you learn the most. Would totally recommend to anyone who wants to understand low-level and systems programming.	CS-107
2	SCPD students, proceed with caution! This course is a huge time sink - as someone who works full-time, I didn't have a single day off for the entire 10 week duration of the course. Nothing in the course was conceptually difficult, the assignments are simply long and grueling. That said, I feel like I've built a strong foundation for future learning, so maybe it was worth it.	CS-107
2	This class lives up to the hype of being very difficult, but it's not impossible. Just make sure that you take this class during a quarter you know you will be able to devote a lot of time to doing the assignments, especially the last few weeks. Also, take this class with Chris Gregg if you can. I absolutely loved him as a professor, and he was super present and helpful to answer questions on Ed and over email. He even took time out of his super busy schedule in Week 9 to meet with me one-on-one to go over the results of one of my assignments. He's actually the best. Overall, this class is really hard, but it's super satisfying in the end, and the concepts are actually really interesting to learn.	CS-107
2	It's definitely a time-consuming class, especially including the time spent in office hours. Although the material and assignments can be challenging, it is a worthwhile experience to learn as much as you do in the span of 10 weeks. I'd highly recommend taking this course with Chris Gregg!	CS-107
2	This course is very challenging and can be very rewarding, but be prepared to spend a significant amount of hours on the assignments. Do not miss lectures! This class is heavy in regards to content and hours per week so I would not recommend taking it along other difficult classes.	CS-107
2	Very nice course	CS-107
2	Takes a lot of time. Very valuable course.	CS-107
2	Good class, moves a bit fast especially at the end. Take it with Chris Gregg!	CS-107
2	It's a lot of work, but a lot of fun!	CS-107
2	Be prepared to work hard and early on the assignments. Otherwise, this course really develops your maturity as a coder.	CS-107
2	It takes time and patience! Office hours are very helpful, and start the assignments early. Last 2 assignments do take a lot of time.	CS-107
2	Don't be afraid of this class! It is difficult, but the content is super interesting and the psets are direct applications of the material. Take advantage of office hours and learn gdb early on.	CS-107
2	I would tell a future student that the class can be extremely frustrating but also extremely rewarding. Extremely frustrating because the class goes into great depths for each topic and to fully complete the assignments you will likely spend hours debugging a problem that is very simple. However once you put the hours and work in and you solve the problem, you will feel a great sense of accomplishment that will make the class worth it.	CS-107
2	Make sure to start on the assignments early and go to office hours for any help. Also, make sure to go to labs, especially, the last two labs because they are very important for the last two assignments (Secure Vault & Heap Allocator). Take the course with Dr. Chris Gregg because he will go above and beyond to help you succeed in this course. Dr. Chris Gregg will stay up until 1 in the morning answering everyone's Ed post questions in a short amount of time.	CS-107
2	It's good but hard	CS-107
2	Hard but rewarding	CS-107
2	Be prepared to work a lot. You have a lot less help than in 106B and the content is a lot harder. At times, this course is extremely frustrating.	CS-107
2	This class is a lot of work, but is also very rewarding! Your programming skills will improve a lot over the course - but I highly advise against taking the course unless you have to for your major/minor. The assignments are extremely thorough and will test your knowledge of each intricate detail. It's to the point where it can be extremely frustrating where a small detail throws everything off. Additionally, Office Hours can be completely useless at times, with there being extremely few TAs and sometimes dozens of students in the queue. The TAs themselves are super helpful, but getting access to them can be nearly impossible at times, and it can often feel like you're on your own. But overall, the course content is extremely interesting and engaging. But the assignments (looking at you, heap allocator) can be extremely tedious and time consuming. Budget your time accordingly!	CS-107
2	extremely time consuming but very much doable even if you are worried about CS/math, course staff is very helpful, just make sure to put in the work	CS-109
2	Overall the class is really fun and I would recommend taking it with Chris Piech. He is an excellent instructor and he has a passion for teaching (which helped me understand a lot of the material). The class does ramp up on difficulty, especially for the final 3 weeks but the new PSET app that professor Chris made is extremely helpful (you are able to check your answers!)	CS-109
2	CS 109 is almost like a review if you have taken AP Stats or Econ 102A beforehand. The machine learning part in the end goes very fast, however, and I honestly donEt think I learned it well. This is why you should go to lecture!	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is the BEST. The course is alright, but having a great instructor like Chris makes it one of my favorite classes at Stanford so far. The TAs all reflect Chris's energy and make learning that much more enjoyable. Pay attention to lectures and USE THE READER (it's very well organized) and you should be fine.	CS-109
2	I tell most people to take the course, its a great staff and a great course	CS-109
2	Great course! Great instructor. Very fun	CS-109
2	Great course. Take it with Chris Piech.	CS-109
2	Love love love this class- Chris Piech is the best and all the TAs are so genuinely nice and helpful	CS-109
2	Chris is without a doubt passionate about teaching and dedicated to ensuring students achieve the learning goals of the course.	CS-109
2	Amazing course. Chris is an amazing lecturer and the way he teaches will open your eyes to the world of probability	CS-109
2	Highly recommend this course especially if taught by Chris Piech. Piech is single-handedly one of the most kind hearted, most genuine professors IEve met and had the pleasure to go to lecture and learn from. His policies to make sure that the studentEs health and own well being always come first is what makes him such a delight to work with, and he does it such a way that helps you learn and actually wants to make you truly learn the content and not just Efinish the PSETE. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone considering taking this class.	CS-109
2	I highly recommend CS109 with Chris Piech. Dr. Piech made class exciting and fun, and the maxim that learning is a fundamental joy really shines through both lectures and conversations with Dr. Piech. Office hours were perhaps too quick to just give the answers away, but overall I felt very supported. Comparatively much easier course than CS103.	CS-109
2	Really great intro course with an amazing teaching team.	CS-109
2	I procrastinated taking CS 109 because I expected it to be a really terrible class, but I was pleasantly surprised. The content was interesting, the problem sets were useful, and the midterm exam was pretty generous (the final may be a different story, however). I didn't have to watch lectures until the machine learning module, since the course reader, sections, and automatic feedback for psets helped me learn the material.	CS-109
2	Take it, especially if Chris Piech is teaching. Love the man to death, and his personal stories about his wife and kids keep you going throughout the quarter.	CS-109
2	If you want to start thinking of probability in a practical manner beyond just theory, this is the class to take.	CS-109
2	Don't fall behind!	CS-109
2	Cool content and problem sets were interesting. This class was a little frustrating in regards to communication. Things were never posted when they said they were going to be released.	CS-109
2	This was the best class I've taken in my three years as a Symbolic Systems major at Stanford!	CS-109
2	Take it with Chris Piech!!! He is the kindest, brightest, and most adorable human on the planet. He really cares about making sure you learn, and he is always happy to take questions. Plus, his excitement for probability is infectious. You'll learn a ton and the psets are fun! We used an online pset app that gives you a cute green checkmark (and a rush of serotonin) when it checks your answer and it's correct. All of chris' examples and homework problems are very applied so you always see the use of what you're learning.	CS-109
2	The pset app is superb. Awesome for motivation and learning for students. Every class should do this. Interesting to see difference between real time answer checking to the conventional method. I think the prior is better.	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is a great instructor who really cares about teaching the content in a way that is meaningful to the students. Highly recommend this class for anyone interested.	CS-109
2	An excellent accompanying course for CS109, especially if you tend to find Math or CS more difficulty. I highly recommend.	CS-109
1	Dr. Lee is by far the best CS professor I've had so far. You can really tell how well she wants students to succeedEespecially in difficult circumstancesEand her enthusiasm for the subject makes her teaching so much more engaging and effective.	CS-103
1	Take it! Super fun class!	CS-103
1	This course was more challenging for me than the more coding-rigorous classes like CS107. I think it was challenging because I had never done any formal proof writing in the context of computer abstractions. I learned a lot but I feel like it is a course that shapes the course load one takes for that quarter.	CS-103
1	Take it-- this is an extremely fun class! You learn the proof-writing foundations you'll need for CS math and also its applications in CS theory. I preferred attending lectures in-person. Having a pset partner is a great idea if you still hold yourself responsible for completing the whole assignment by yourself ahead of time, too.	CS-103
1	I would take into consideration your holistic course load when considering whether or not to enroll in this course. I inadvertently overburdened myself during this quarter, taking 18 credits, and although 18 is a generally feasible number of units to take concurrently, I had underestimated the time that this course takes throughout the week. The homework is best completed if one has a head start on it, to be able to attend Office Hours if any questions arise (another extremely critical point that I cannot stress enough: Go to Office Hours whenever possible!! Attending office hours was the reason I was able to make my way through the course). You can get a lot out of enrolling in CS103ECynthia is such a knowledgeable instructor who teaches extremely well and the course material is fascinating and provides an in-depth foundation into computer programmingEbut make sure that you don't overburden yourself so that you can get the most out of the course!	CS-103
1	Definitely recommend, Cynthia Lee has a great teaching style and empathy toward students. Content is difficult but can be understood.	CS-103
1	This is such a good class for someone who has never written a proof in their life. I cannot get over how much I think everyone should take this class when Dr. Lee is teaching it. I have learned so much and can genuinely say, for someone who is not really a math person, this has been my favorite math class at Stanford so far. Office hours are really helpful and the TAs are great!	CS-103
1	This class exposes you to a lot of fascinating concepts in the world of mathematics and computing, and teaches a certain style of proof writing that will be useful in future coursework.	CS-103
1	Great class, a lot of work but doable :)	CS-103
1	I liked this course! I found it very, very difficult however. Psets took up an extremely great deal of my time and concepts were challenging. The course is well organized. Cynthia is great and extremely supportive.	CS-103
1	Tough class and the content does not feel applicable some of the time.	CS-103
1	This course covers a lot of interesting ground, but most of the homework is proofwriting, which makes everything seem more miserable than it has potential to be. If you don't enjoy the course, don't let it turn you off of CS as a whole.	CS-103
1	Content was really interesting but Cynthia was not very accommodating for extensions/accomodations, often not responding to email requests or giving extensions after the deadline passed, which defeats the purpose.	CS-103
1	highly recommend taking to improve your proofwriting and learn about theory in computer science. i took this course at the same time as cs107 and while i wouldn't recommend doing so, it is doable.	CS-103
1	Take it! The teaching team is fantastic and the material is really interesting! Definitely challenging but there is so much support and the lectures are an amazing resource	CS-103
1	Start assignments early and reread them often. This class is as much about HOW you make a claim as WHAT the claim actually is, so having the chance to refine your language is essential if you would like to be successful in this class. If you take this approach, this class will teach you a great deal about how to approach general problem solving.	CS-103
1	I would say definitely consider taking it if you have a strong knowledge of discrete math and/or how to write mathematical proofs. If not, I would still recommend it, it's just that it will take a bit more time to understand all the materials, especially how to do the problem sets (since I had to go through this).	CS-103
1	Great class! Cythnia teaches the concepts very well and makes it easy for me to understand even though I had no prior experience with proofs.	CS-103
1	It is a fun class if you like logic puzzles. Be sure to strictly adhere to the specific format/syntax presented in lecture, as the teaching staff marks down for not doing so.	CS-103
1	I actually really enjoyed this course. Definitely make use of office hours as much as possible and you will be fine. It is a very formulaic class in that once you determine the write approach style you are fine.	CS-103
1	Good class. Professor lee is great and understanding so would def recommend taking it with them if possible.	CS-103
1	Very great teacher	CS-103
2	It's taught fine, but the psets are inordinately time-consuming.	CS-161
2	Moses taught the material in a fairly structured and logical manner, but Nima's lectures felt a bit disorganized at times. Many of the problem sets were extremely time consuming. The general consensus among students seemed to be that midterm exam was too long, and the final exam was too difficult. But, if you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. Good luck!	CS-161
2	It's a lot of work, and the paradigms are among the most beautiful things I've ever learned.	CS-161
2	You learn a lot about computer algorithms and this course teaches you really important concepts!	CS-161
2	Great for coding interviews, start your hws on time + go to OH	CS-161
2	Nima and Moses are cuties. Hard class though. But cool; definitely more interesting than 103.	CS-161
2	This course was not my thing. I found it rather boring but the class is well structured and run well.	CS-161
2	An extreme, ridiculous amount of work.	CS-161
2	This is a challenging but very rewarding course. The skills you learn will also help you succeed in algorithmic interview questions.	CS-161
2	You probably have to take it for your major anyways.  If you don't there's not too much of a point.	CS-161
2	The teaching staff was more concerned with ensuring academic honesty than over well being and learning for the class. Some CA's would not help at all at office hours while others would. Overall, it sucks that CS students need to take this for a requirement because the class is so poorly taught.	CS-161
2	This class is terrible. It's a real shame because it's a required course in the CS core and the concepts are really interesting. The professors (Moses and Nima) are probably the worst instructors I've ever had. Not only do they suck at teaching, they also have no empathy for students at all. The biggest example of this was the insane 22 page take home midterm they gave us that they told us would take 3 hours, but took more like 12 (literally, not an exaggeration). When hundreds of students cheated, instead of taking any responsibility for creating an environment that promoted cheating (the instructors literally broke the honor code), they just said how disappointed they were in all of us with no recognition in their own faults. So one piece of advice: I don't know about the other instructors, but if you have to take this class DO NOT take it with Moses or Nima. Terrible experience.	CS-161
2	This course covers a lot of content and is very fast paced, but the content is extremely interesting. The midterm was 48 hours and very difficult. The midterm (and the whole class) was a wave of emotion - sometimes it was fun coming up with algorithms, other times it was very miserable. Nima and Moses are decent instructors, and it was easy to follow along for the most part.	CS-161
2	Shoutout to Jose for literally carrying us for all the psets with his office hours. If you ever have the chance to go, GO. He's really good at breaking down the problem and helping us figure out the steps along the way into something that we can work towards a solution for.	CS-161
2	Just a really poorly run class. Almost half of our psets (3/8) were ungraded at the time of the final. The instructors would refuse to offer in-depth explanations to practice final questions on Ed and instead suggest that another student step up and explain it... days before the final. Answer keys were often unreliable and riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. Some answers were clearly written by TAs without a very strong grasp on the topic. Oh, and the midterm was by far the most unreasonable exam I've ever seen at Stanford, even though it was take-home! Don't take unless it's mandatory, and even then I wouldn't suggest taking it with Moses/Nima.	CS-161
2	I would tell the student that homework requires a significant amount of time, and to make sure to go over problems with peers to make sure that they didn't make any silly mistakes that could easily be fixed.	CS-161
2	Most of the work in this class are the PSETs. Make sure to start them early, and refer to lecture notes often when you are stuck.	CS-161
2	Honestly don't take this unless it's taught better	CS-161
2	The lectures do not coincide with the PSETs: the PSETs are much harder. There is quite the disconnect between how simple the lectures seem and how difficult the PSETs are. Also, just note, probably one of the most difficult midterms I've taken at Stanford. 22 pages take home...	CS-161
2	I guess CS majors have to take it. This class was simply not enjoyable. I don't want to waste my time writing a long complaint about Nima and Moses.	CS-161
2	This class is really hard. Expect to spend lots of time on the psets.	CS-161
2	"This course definitely takes more time than what a 5 unit course should be. Grading is pretty harsh on proofs, and they're very particular about wording everything exactly. Even though the homework assignments are very hard and very time consuming, everyone scores close to perfect on them, which is super stressful since the class is graded on a curve. Our midterm exam was supposed to take 3 hours, but the overall consensus was that the 22 page take home midterm took people AT LEAST 16 hours and above. Course instructors are super out of touch with the experiences of an average Stanford student. I really did give this course the good old college try, but basically to get an A, you'll have to end up camping office hours for the homework solutions. Moses and Nima say that if you work hard, you can get a good grade, but in my experience, if you work hard, there's no way for you to do super well other than being EXTREMELY nitpicky on your own assignments, rather than truly understanding the material. The wording for homework is pretty convoluted, so if you don't check Edstem clarification posts, there's often no way you will get the correct answer. If you submit reasonable answers based on the unclear wording, you'll get docked for points and then the justification is that ""we cleared up misunderstandings on Ed,"" which is extremely frustrating because the instructions should've been written well in the first place. You could understand the material and still get screwed over because everyone's perfect, meaning that there's pressure on you to be perfect as well or else you'll get screwed over by the curve. It's very frustrating because the amount of effort you put in for an assignment will not reflect the end result grade on homework assignments that you will get. I came into this course very excited to learn about the content and am leaving it extremely frustrated with how ethics lectures are jammed in, how the weekly time commitment is a lot, and about how learning is absolutely destroyed because myself and others will tend to focus on the small nitpicky parts of grades as a result of how this class is structured. The instructors are well-meaning and very clear about their intentions to not harm students, but good intentions don't consistently substitute for a good learning experience."	CS-161
2	Pretty difficult class with long psets at the beginning and lots of content covered but it is all necessary	CS-161
2	161 is a pretty tough class, but you probably knew that already. The teaching staff is okay, but they rush through some harder topics it feels. A lot of the learning and aha moments have to be done yourself. Midterm was brutal. psets can be okay, but some unfair questions every now and then that just destroy a week.Take with caution.	CS-161
2	Psets are time consuming, but  you will learn a lot about how to design algorithms well.	CS-161
2	Great course but very time-consuming! Start psets early and go to office hours. Exams are very tough.	CS-161
2	its a difficult class but you can learn a lot if you put in the time to. i think the profs did care about us, even though the tests were really difficult. the staff was pretty supportive and the TAs were amazing (especially Jerry and Jose)	CS-161
2	Midterm was extremely difficult because it was take home and did not take the allotted number of times. The first few PSETs can be quite difficult and the difficulty of each PSET is not uniform. However, in-person office hours are really good and the TAs were knowledgeable so definitely take advantage of that.	CS-161
2	Be prepared to work hard	CS-161
2	This course is amazing! It is a must-take for anyone pursuing any technical / engineering degree at Stanford. Every field uses algorithms in some form or fashion. This course gives you an immense understanding and appreciation for algorithms and data structures that is super helpful for anyone in an engineering or technical field.	CS-161
2	Not a great class. Only take it if you absolutely have to (in which case I feel sorry for you).	CS-161
2	Jose is the BEST ta! I found the teaching team to be too intleligent to explain thigns at my level but a good TA can really carry you through the Course.	CS-161
2	Very tough	CS-161
2	Assignments are lengthy and challenging. Lots of pseudocode to write. Do not overload yourself with other courses if you are planning to take this course. Start assignments early, go to office hours for clarifications, work with classmates.	CS-161
2	Great course, Moses is an awesome lecturer. Content is definitely useful and applicable, but unless you have prior experience in algorithms don't take it your freshman year.	CS-161
2	This course contains incredibly practical material. Algorithms are the core of practical, performant software, and they're very important for internship interviews in CS. That said, all the interesting and important material is buried in anthropomorphic animal hell. The course materials look like they're designed for small children, not college students.	CS-161
2	I absolutely loved taking this class. Algorithm's were intimidating at the start of the quarter but through CS 161 I've slowly built up a stronger intuition for correct, efficient problem solving across a wide variety of domains.	CS-161
2	As a core cs class, you have to take it and you will be better after taking it. However, if you have to take it with Moses and/or Nima it definitely highlights so many pain points in the CS department. This class can really kill the joy for CS. For reference, I'm on the systems track. There is a way to teach difficult content in a EfairE effective way. This class did not do this. In fact, this has been a class my least favorite class of the entire core (except 109). Lectures are horrible. Bruh up on the different types of algorithms (youTube, geeks4geeks), 103 (reviewing old psets), and 109 (in depth 109 review needed!! this class can get unnecessarily heavy on the 109). Moses and Nima are very intelligent and want people to succeed, but don't actually teach. Lecture is a bunch of crammed slides with dense material and very little time to understand it before the next pset is due. Homework is unreasonably challenging, half my time was spent just trying to understand what they were asking/talking about. Go to Office Hours early, because OH at the end of the week is SO AWFULLY unhelpful. Find a good TA and make time to go to their OH and/or section because you will waste so much time just trying to understand what they're asking - just to be wrong.  	CS-161
2	The slides for this class are helpful and the sections are very helpful as well.	CS-161
2	Likely redundant for most students, but required for the major.	CS-161
2	The course is very well taught and the TAs are incredible.  Moreover, all the knowledge gained is very practical - you learn problem solving skills.	CS-161
2	Definitely the hardest CS class I've taken at Stanford so far. Start early on problem sets and go to office hours for help. Ed posts are also essential.	CS-161
2	This class was a traumatic experience from start to finish. The TAs for this course are incompetent at best and actually offer conflicting information on the problem sets. I find it truly strange that the TAs themselves don't seem to be on the same page at all on the problems, so I don't understand how the course staff expect the students to come up with the correct solution. With the exception of a couple TAs, most TAs are also very reluctant to give out solutions, which I totally understand, but it starts to get ridiculous when even basic questions go unanswered and it feels like you cannot get any help at all. The problem sets themselves are long and arduous, and quite frankly very difficult to complete without going to OH weekly multiple times--you need to have flashes of intuition which is tricky to develop. I would basically sit in OH all week and hope that TAs gave out some nuggets of information. Moses' lecturing was alright but Nima's was often scattered and left me more confused than when I started. The content is already difficult to begin with, so the lackluster lecturing certainly does not help. The midterm was also startlingly long (although it was supposed to take 3 hours, which was a complete lie) and I imagine the final will be a similar situation. Overall, this class has significantly dampened my mental health this quarter and I cannot wait for this experience to be over. If you're a CS major, you have to take this course (which I do believe is the hardest of the CS core, even more so than 110), so I just grit your teeth and try to get through it.	CS-161
2	Go to office hours and try to find a study group very early on. It's a very tough course so be sure to take it with lighter classes.	CS-161
2	This class is difficult, but rewarding. I definitely left this class with more knowledge than I had going into it. Though a lot of work, I believe that the skillset you develop in this class makes everything worth it.	CS-161
2	Don' take it in winter	CS-161
2	Lots of resources from the staff. Midterm can be very hard. Instructors are good at presenting different topics however HW instructions can be ambiguous at times.	CS-161
2	CS 161 can be a great class. Just dont take it with moses or nima.	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are great lecturers but the problem sets are often too hard to do own your own. Come into this class with a study group or prepare to go to office hours every week. The grading rubric is harsh and very specific so be prepared. Course policy is a bit weird since they encourage students to discuss answers during office hours.	CS-161
2	This course is awesome and perfect in so many ways. Highly recommend it to anyone interested in fundamental algorithmic design.	CS-161
2	This is a great course for you if you want to learn basic knowledge about algorithm, and maybe decide to dig into one kind of algorithm later on, but if you want to learn it very well, you'll definitely put a lot of effort into this course.	CS-161
2	I would emphasize learning a small bit of probability to be able to seamlessly jump in. Otherwise the class is pretty beginner friendly.	CS-161
2	It is what it is. Not too bad of a time commitment in terms of workload but the content is a bit more difficult compared to CS 103 or CS 109	CS-161
2	Take it if you have to	CS-161
2	This class is terrible. It's a real shame because it's a required course in the CS core and the concepts are really interesting. The professors (Moses and Nima) are probably the worst instructors I've ever had. Not only do they suck at teaching, they also have no empathy for students at all. The biggest example of this was the insane 22 page take home midterm they gave us that they told us would take 3 hours, but took more like 12 (literally, not an exaggeration). When hundreds of students cheated, instead of taking any responsibility for creating an environment that promoted cheating (the instructors literally broke the honor code), they just said how disappointed they were in all of us with no recognition in their own faults. So one piece of advice: I don't know about the other instructors, but if you have to take this class DO NOT take it with Moses or Nima. Terrible experience.	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are good people, but easily the worst computer science teachers I have had so far (compared to Piech, Kieth, Chris Gregg, Troccoli, etc.). It just seems like they don't really care about teaching as much. Sometimes they don't really even know what's gunna pop up on the next slide, as they don't make their own. Also, the lectures just do not prepare you for the homework; they skip the most important slides and just never show you how to do things that you need to do. Anyways, you have to take it so I'm just ranting. Have fun.	CS-161
2	Shoutout to Jose for literally carrying us for all the psets with his office hours. If you ever have the chance to go, GO. He's really good at breaking down the problem and helping us figure out the steps along the way into something that we can work towards a solution for.	CS-161
2	The material was very interesting and struggling through the PSETs is rewarding and where most of the learning will come from! Unfortunately, the instruction in lectures was very hard to consume and not immediately relevant / applicable to the psets always. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on problems because they are often vague and worded poorly.	CS-161
2	Good course for a more in-depth review of algorithms. Cheating was rampant the quarter I took it.	CS-161
2	This is one of the most useful classes I have taken at Stanford. The class is tough but it is definitely worth it.	CS-161
2	Honestly don't take this unless it's taught better	CS-161
2	It is definitely a challenging course but will be rewarding in the end. Utilize office hours and don't fall behind on lectures.	CS-161
2	I guess CS majors have to take it. This class was simply not enjoyable. I don't want to waste my time writing a long complaint about Nima and Moses.	CS-161
2	I do not feel this class was well organized. There were too many sources and content to cover. There were lectures, lecture notes (to be read after lecture), pre-lecture exercises, post-lecture exercises, textbook reading, section and section problems, psets, and then midterm and final exams. I feel this could have been better synthesized and structured so that students could understand what content was important. The class itself is hard and time consuming, but you will learn a lot.	CS-161
2	A great course for an introduction to algorithms. I would suggest taking it with a lighter course load.	CS-161
2	This class takes a lot of work and prepare to spend a lot of time on problem sets.	CS-161
2	The class is hard to get a good grade because the medium score is so high. Go to the office hours and check the answer with your friends.	CS-161
2	If you're attentive when watching/attending lecture and give yourself time to think through the homework problems thoroughly, you can really become comfortable with the material. I think that the more effort you can put into solidifying concepts soon after they are presented in lecture (like doing concept checks), the more you will get out of the course. I feel quite satisfied with the pacing of the course and level of difficulty of the problems in psets and exams (although the midterm was a bit much)--it's enough to push you, but not unreasonable. All of the material is organized and there is plenty of support on Ed and in office hours.	CS-161
2	Fast-paced class, but very worth it	CS-161
2	Make sure you review the slides after lecture, and if you watch recorded lectures asynchronously, pause to check your understanding. The midterm and final are very tough.	CS-161
2	"Take it if you have to. Moses and Nima seem like great people, but they (especially Nima) are not great at teaching. Nima in particular will waffle a lot and tell you to ""convince yourself that it is true"" for the material that you came to class to learn. The ethics lectures are poorly integrated as well - they just felt like extra work and they didn't really relate to the things that we were learning. We could have been looking at examples of how algorithms had led to ethical issues, but we didn't. The problem sets are also often confusingly worded and require a lot of time in office hours to solve."	CS-161
2	This is a tough class, with very conceptualy challenging content and really difficult assignments. There seemed to often be a big jump between assignments and lectures, so go to OHs as early and often as you need to get a handle on why the problems are the way they are. Without the lovely TAs/CAs that were helping us throughout the quarter, I wouldn't have made it past any of the assignments. The midterms and finals for this year were extremely difficult, specifically the final. So if you have to take this class for your major/minor, expect to put in a LOT of effort if you want a decent grade.	CS-161
2	Please attend OHs, and go to section. It'll make things easier.	CS-161
2	This course will probably take up most of your time. Make sure to take it with easier courses!	CS-161
2	I absolutely loved taking this class. Algorithm's were intimidating at the start of the quarter but through CS 161 I've slowly built up a stronger intuition for correct, efficient problem solving across a wide variety of domains.	CS-161
2	This course is quite difficult, not only because of the content itself, but because of the instruction and learning gap between lectures and psets.	CS-161
2	Really straightforward class. Watch the lectures, do the pset each week, finish the midterm, complete the final, and that's all that counts for your grade. They also offer a lot of supplementary material (sections, pre-lecture exercises, post-lecture concept checks). I felt like I got a lot out of the course just doing the pre-lecture exercises before lecture and going over the section problems to study for exams, but you'll ultimately get out what you put in.	CS-161
2	Pros: This class is very helpful if you're a CS major going for SWE. Technical interviews feel way easier after taking 161. Plus, algorithms are pretty fundamental to CS in general. You'll feel a lot more confident with CS after this class. Plus, the PSETs often feel like solving puzzles, so if you enjoy that, you should enjoy the problem sets. Lastly, the TAs are amazing. Cons: This class is incredibly difficult. Sometimes, the lectures feel like they are jumping around and skipping steps (took with Moses and Nima). Definitely be ready to put in time and effort to succeeding in this class.	CS-161
2	Definitely the hardest CS class I've taken at Stanford so far. Start early on problem sets and go to office hours for help. Ed posts are also essential.	CS-161
2	nothing	CS-161
2	Go to office hours and try to find a study group very early on. It's a very tough course so be sure to take it with lighter classes.	CS-161
2	This course is one of the most difficult courses in the CS core. I'm being upfront when I say that one has to be on top of the content. Personally, I relied on lecture too much to learn the content and only realized at the end of the quarter that I needed more supplementary material. Office hours and Ed Discussion carried me through this class. Just be aware that the difference between what is learned in lecture and what is expected in the PSETS is pretty stark. I suggest putting substantial time into this class.	CS-161
2	I mean youre taking it cuz its required, but its better than 107 or 103, and feels more applicable.	CS-161
2	CS 161 can be a great class. Just dont take it with moses or nima.	CS-161
2	Definitely a very important course!	CS-161
2	Really challenging course but helpful for building algorithm knowledge. Teaching team was unresponsive to the students' needs and did not make any changes based on feedback. Handled academic dishonesty poorly and only lost trust from students. Exams and assignments were much harder than class material and teaching team did not seem to want to answer our questions properly and help us succeed. It was almost as if they wanted us not to do well in this class. I genuinely wanted to have fun and learn, but they made it really hard to do so because I felt I had to worry so much about my grade and being able to get all the psets done (they were so so long).	CS-161
2	Avery is the best! He goes above and beyond his duties as an ACE TA, giving us lots of helpful tips and extra practice material and always willing to answer questions, no matter when we ask them. Even though there were challenges with having some students online and some in person, I feel like Avery did a great job making sure everyone was learning. Avery also presents material in a very clear way with diagrams and language, and always made sure to upload section material for us.	CS-161
2	Avery is amazing, take it if you can and try to sign up for ACE when the application comes out or else you may be at the mercy of the waitlist!	CS-161
2	"This course is definitely not easy. However, I don't think it's the horror story that many people describe it to be. It's just so fast paced which is very unfortunate. It is hard to soak in what they are teaching because they throw so much at you and give you no time to absorb it. Find friends to help you through this class. Exams are tough and don't always match what is taught in the course - you are expected to ""apply"" what you have learned which can be frustrating. If you are willing to put in the time, you will succeed. Gene Kim is very entertaining and a great professor who helps ease the pain."	MATH-51
2	"This course is by no means ""easy,"" but I would recommend it to everyone at Stanford. Even if you are majoring in English or Art Practice, you should still seize the opportunity to take this class while you can. In a way, you learn all the math you ever have before college in ten weeks, from adding to graphing representations of 3 dimensional figures, but through the perspective of vectors which are honestly just super cool. Even if you hate math, you should want to know the things taught in this course, or at least, appreciate them a little more. It can be a lot of work, but its worth it."	MATH-51
2	This class is very hard but super rewarding. If you're gonna take it then definitely get Gene Kim. He knows exactly how to present the material in a way that is both understandable yet thorough. I didn't feel like he rushed the process and provided annotated notes afterwards in case you fell behind in lecture. He was patient in class and answered all and any questions asked. He made the potentially grueling class fun. Get ready to work hard, but if you put in the time, you can complete the course!	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is one of those required classes that most students end up taking before they graduate. While challenging, the material itself can be interesting, particularly if well taught. It would be better with a recorded component.	MATH-51
2	This class can feel a little overwhelming at times. It's hard to catch back up if you fall behind and there aren't many accommodations made if something happens that causes you to fall behind. Overall, I learned a lot, but the class was rigorous and it's important to stay on top of the content.	MATH-51
2	My experience in this course most definitely depended on the people I took it with. This course was only bearable for me because of my dormmates, Gene's annotated notes, and Sophia's office hours. Make sure you're satisfied with your lecturer. Find people to study and do psets with. Find a TA whose office hours you really like and go to them consistently. Don't slack off or else you'll be really stressed come exam time. Go to lecture and section and do your best to soak everything in. Overall, a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and I learned a lot.	MATH-51
2	Take it for a course requirement. But do not expect to enjoy it, even if you don't find it difficult. Tedious material and takes away from the joy of doing math.	MATH-51
2	Get prepared for exams out of left field.	MATH-51
2	Take this over CME 100 and the Math 20 series if you are premed. It is much easier than CME because this is all computational work and it is the only quarter of math you would need for premed.	MATH-51
2	Gene's lecture notes are a lifesaver. At one point I stopped going to lecture to give myself time to work through his notes at my own pace (lecture can be really fast especially during the second half of the quarter) and it made it much easier to understand. Definitely keep on top of things because the class moves fast and concepts build upon one another. Exams were the sort of problems I expected. As long as you grind and ask for clarification as soon as possible, you should be fine.	MATH-51
2	Put in the time and youEll be rewarded	MATH-51
2	Definintely look into other sources for learning the course material along with the lectures.	MATH-51
2	This class is extremely overhyped in difficulty. The biggest issue is understanding the reasoning behind many of the techniques you do in class, and once you do, everything flows naturally from that point. The psets were never hard, I simply suggest you understand why/how plugging in those numbers have such an effect.	MATH-51
2	It's a pretty manageable class	MATH-51
2	Interesting but very fast paced and feels like a 7 unit class. Don't recommend taking other hard classes when taking this class.	MATH-51
2	Prepare early for midterms and finals. Content is cumulative, so stay on track.	MATH-51
2	this course is manageable as long as you make sure not to fall behind. The moment you do, you will suffer.	MATH-51
2	If you take this class, make sure to be consistent with your studying. It is easy to fall behind and if you do, try to catch up as soon as possible.	MATH-51
2	Discussion is very helpful.	MATH-51
2	The professors and TA's teaching and organization of the course is done well. However, the class is taught at such an intense pace that it doesn't much matter. Unless you're taking a very light course load, find mathematics extremely easy, or took some form of multivariable calculus or linear algebra in the past, it's very hard to keep up in this class. At other schools, learning multivariable calculus and linear algebra in the span of ten weeks sounds insane. This class feels like more than five units. Every lecture covers so much material and every lecture builds upon the previous lectures, so it's very easy to fall behind, at which point it's even harder to catch up. This class is required for a lot of STEM majors, so find comfort in the fact that many students have to take it and you'll probably have a lot of friends or dormmates to struggle through the course with and study with. Don't do this class alone, find others to do homework with. Good luck.	MATH-51
2	Definitely a tough class to take. Make sure you start each section of your problem sets immediately after its corresponding lectures so you don't fall too far behind in the class.	MATH-51
2	The pace of the learning is very fast. Make sure to go to all discussion sections and lectures.	MATH-51
2	Not great but needed for prerequisites. Lucronovic explains things well but Gene has more examples which is often more helpful.	MATH-51
2	It goes really fast so make sure you understand concepts when they're first learned so studying for exams is actually studying rather than trying to learn five entire chapter of math in one night	MATH-51
2	Wow, the amount of thought that went into organizing this course was phenomenal. The textbook is amazingly helpful, the instructors/TAs are all awesome, and the material itself is fascinating. I've heard horror stories about this class, and now that I've experienced the class, I'm not sure why.	MATH-51
2	It goes fast. Do the readings beforehand.	MATH-51
2	Students should be advised that this course moves very fast. We cover 1 textbook chapter per class (3 chapters per week), but if there is a week where the class does not occur, that chapter is moved to the next week meaning 4 chapters are covered during a week where students attend 3 math lectures. Not only is this class fast but the topics covered can be quite abstract, depending on your familiarity. 2 midterms and 1 final in addition to weekly psets. I would suggest a student to be prepared for all of this	MATH-51
2	Reading the textbook is critical to doing well on exams -- not everything on exams is covered during lecture. Keep up and you'll be fine. Make sure to not fall behind	MATH-51
2	The quality of instruction for Math 51 is highly dependent on the instructor. I had Mark Lucianovic,who unfortunately wasn't the best lecturer and left me behind other Math 51 students. Please use 3Blue1Brown to visualize the linear algebra portion of the class! Math 21 was not necessary at all for this course from what I've seen. Midterms and Finals this quarter were pretty similar to the practices (some a bit harder and some easier). Keep up with section, do lots of practice problems, go to office hours, and you'll be set. Not the nightmare most people say it is & doable without previous Linear/MVC experience.	MATH-51
2	Its hard haha!	MATH-51
2	/	MATH-51
2	Obviously a tough class for everyone, but teachers are super supportive and office hours are a huge help. Gene and his annotated notes are also super helpful. Def need would reccomend reading the textbook as well.	MATH-51
2	Very time-intensive course, if you are thinking of taking this course for a major requirement, make sure to prioritize this class and stay on top of the readings and psets.	MATH-51
2	I would recommend coming into this course with the slightest bit of knowledge on linear algebra and/or multivariable calculus, just so the concepts don't seem so new, especially with the fast pacing of the course.	MATH-51
2	Lucianovic is a really nice guy, but it's not rare that he doesn't make it all the way through the lecture notes. You'll have to teach yourself a lot of the material, but the psets are honestly really helpful and the textbook is probably the best math textbook I've ever had -- conveys the important material well, lowkey funny at times, has great resources for studying. I didn't have any multivar or linear algebra experience coming into this class and it honestly wasn't too bad, although the final did kick my butt.	MATH-51
2	Not as bad as many said on carta. Lectures are interesting and assignments & tests are mildly challenging but fair.	MATH-51
2	Remember to go to all the lectures and give yourself enough time to digest the textbook. It is very hard to catch up if you don't hone your knowledge well enough for each class. I'd say that one thing I regret the most is that I did not go to two lectures, and they all showed up in the finals...so def make sure you understand all the concepts before the text!	MATH-51
2	I absolutely loved this course, although I did spend quite a significant amount of time on this. The textbook, the lectures, and the discussion worksheets were all very helpful in my understanding of the course material. This class requires a lot of independent studying, but if you find a study group to go over material with, it will be a very enjoyable experience.	MATH-51
2	The course content is difficult as expected, but read the textbook well and rely on office hours/section and you'll be fine.	MATH-51
2	This is a really laborious and stressful class. The math itself is not impossible, but the amount of material covered is simply too much to be processed over the amount of time it is taught, and the tests are usually more difficult than majority of the practice you receive. Be ready to work really hard.	MATH-51
2	The class is advertised as having an active learning structure, but for me it felt more like a learn it myself structure. I definitely had to rely on out of class resources.	MATH-51
2	Don't fall behind on lectures, check your answers to psets with other people	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a great class. If you stay on top of the reading and engage with lecture it feels fairly doable. The textbook is incredibly well written and thorough and really complements the examples given in lecture (take with Gene Kim if you want very example heavy lectures).	MATH-51
2	Great class! You will learn a lot about linear algebra, which is very applicable to a lot of fields.	MATH-51
2	Although this course is famously challenging at Stanford, I would still encourage future students to take it. After all, we are not here for easy things. As a potential engineering major, I was considering between the CME series and the Math series. After talking to my UAD and the professors of my potential major, I figured out that taking either of them would be both helpful for an engineering major. If you have similar concerns, don't worry too much about which series is the best/the right one. Start the psets early and discuss with peers. Go to lectures and discussions. Preview and review right before and after the lectures. Do the examples in the textbook. Redo the problems on the lecture worksheets. This course is fun; the problem is just it has a lot to teach, and sometimes I had to sacrifice some details to keep up with the lectures.	MATH-51
2	Don't skip lecture. Start homework early.	MATH-51
2	This is a class that can be very interesting, but is also copious amounts of work. PLEASE go to lecture, start the PSETS early, and find community within the class. If possible, take it with friends! There are a few silver linings, but the test are extremely hard, so just be sure to keep up with lecture in person.	MATH-51
2	Don't take it unless you have to. Interesting stuff, but too much content in too little time.	MATH-51
2	TAKE THIS WITH GENE KIM. You will not regret it. His annotated notes saved my grade and his instruction is fast but gets through a lot of material.	MATH-51
2	Definitely take this course. It's required for most majors, and it's also incredibly useful in so many fields (if you're an econ major, I highly recommend taking it for a letter grade, since you've got to know these concepts well). It's organized and instructed quite well. The class has a daunting reputation, but it's truly not that bad. There is a wealth of support, from TA's, instructors, and other students. If you put in the work, you can definitely come out of it with a good grade. The first 7 weeks are significantly easier than the last three weeks though, so be prepared for it to ramp up. And although the concepts can be hard, the tests end up far easier, and they're pretty lenient about partial credit. Take the course, but it's not all that bad.	MATH-51
2	try not to	MATH-51
2	Be prepared to still turn in assignments and take your tests even if you're on your death bed. I had multiple friends this quarter who had pretty serious conditions to allow exceptions to be made and the Math department wouldn't budge (i.e. one was hit by a car, and the other broke her finger, and neither got any leniency). Also put together a study group because that will save you.	MATH-51
2	This was a very difficult course but it covered material that is the basis for practically every quantitative field, so have fun! There is some absolutely amazing material we learn - that's part of why it's so difficult, because the class goes over high level, useful techniques.	MATH-51
2	One of the hardest courses you will ever take at Stanford. Read the textbook, go to discussion, and work with peers!	MATH-51
2	Gene is a great instructor but writes challenging exams. One of the best taught math classes here due to the coherence (custom textbook, rigorous and time-tested course schedule), but it's really tough. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the course.	MATH-51
2	a lot and very fast paced. Take time to go over material and absorb it for things to make sense. Intuitive though	MATH-51
2	If you want to obtain a good grade in Math 51 is definitely a strong 5 units. The instruction is fine, but you will have to do a lot of the learning yourself outside of class. Homework is application of theory learned in class to problems rather than just learning how to work through problems. Section is not mandatory, but can be helpful some weeks.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a very tough class that you just have to get through. ACE definitely helped my grade and was a great community!!! I didn't learn much in lecture and learned everything in section!	MATH-51
2	The class moves fast but if you stay on top of it, start the homework early, and get help right when you need it (for which there are a lot of resources), then it is doable. I found that working on homework with a few other people to also be helpful and more efficient.	MATH-51
2	Very difficult class. Be ready for the challenge	MATH-51
2	its hard but rewarding	MATH-51
2	It's a difficult course and not very rewarding. Stay on top of the material, watch 3Blue1Brown, and take it with a light quarter.	MATH-51
2	Keep up with the readings and all assigned content. Lectures are usually not long enough to cover the entirety of a chapter, so individual initiative is imperative.	MATH-51
