0	Hard if you don't have a CS background, as it moves very fast. If your good at focusing for long periods and working with puzzles, this is a good class for you
0	Great intro to programming! Highly recommend you take this, even if you don't plan on going into programming or stuff of that manneer.
0	This instructor is very knowledgeable and conveys the material well. The course is logically structured and easy to follow. Due dates are clear and enough time is given to complete the assignments.
0	Take it! Everyone and their mother has taken this class, so there is no shortage of people who can give you advice.
0	It was a great class. One of my worries was that it would be difficult to catch on since I didn't have any experience with CS before taking this class but the way lectures are taught and the way sections are led make it very accessible. It's also really convenient to be able to have the option to watch lecture recordings rather than having to go in person. This was extremely helpful, but I would recommend making yourself go to lecture if you think you'll procrastinate watching the recordings.
0	Very good class. I would highly recommend it. The PSets are very doable with all the resources the class offers, and are appropriately difficult.
0	Very helpful!
0	this class is designed for beginners and to help beginners succeed. midterm/final are not bad and your grade will probably be fine even if you don't put in that much effort, but that being said, if you really want to get a lot out of the course, make sure to spend a lot of time refining concepts and doing psets.
0	I would 100% recommend taking this course to anyone who might be interested. The teaching is excellent and the course material is fun and interesting!
0	Take it, its really hard tho.
0	It is a must-take for any Stanford student! If you can fit it in your schedule comfortably, take it.
0	It is a fairly simple class and all of the classes are recorded so it is nearly asynchronous.
0	ItEs a must-take class for all Stanford students! A very rewarding class that is taught well and isnEt particularly time consuming
0	I would say there was often a gap between the lecture material and the assignments. The directions to the assignments were also often inadequate. I would say this class requires outside help with things like the LAIR or other tutoring options.
0	This class is very well structured.
0	Pace yourself on the homework assignments. Just reading over the directions the day it's posted is a good start because you can think about it here and there for the rest of the week.
0	This class was super fun. Don't take it with a heavy course load though. It can be a lot of work, especially if you have no cs background.
0	Homeworks are very hard if you have little or no coding background experience.
0	.
0	Great introduction into computer science and python coding! The teaching staff really knows what they are doing and everything is very routine. If you put time into learning the basics the class isn't hard to do well in.
0	Nick is a great lecturer, better than most professors.
0	You probably will
0	Great intro to cs donEt be intimidated to take it
0	Absolutely a must-take course for every student at Stanford.
0	Will be very hard if you don't have any prior CS experience. Highly recommended going to OH, LiAR, and section.
0	CS106A with Nick Parlante is a fantastic class and very well taught. I had never taken any sort of programming before and was very nervous but found everything to be super approachable. If you have never coded before expect a bit of a learning curve, but everything is very doable. Take the time to sit down with the problem sets and figure them out. Exams are very doable and fair. I really ended up enjoying everything by the end.
0	Take it!!! I was really nervous about taking this course but it's so well taught and has so many amazing resources to ensure that all students succeed!
0	Take this course with your friends! You can go to classes together and it'll motivate you to do better in the course. It doesn't matter if you've never coded before, you can still learn but go to office hours if you need help even if its on the first week. Also, stick to the pace! Always aim to submit before the late days but if you need to use it that's ok too!
0	Loved it
0	Great course! Learned a lot and showed that coding is a lot more accessible and less scary than it might seem.
0	This course and its level of difficulty is completely dependent on your comfort with math and if you have previous experience with cs. This class is not very accessible to non-stem majors unless they have taken high-level math classes. The instruction can sometimes be spotty as Nick does not understand that some things must be explained more in depth and this can make it so you have to do a lot of self-teaching. Section is helpful if you have a good TA.
0	Take it with Nick Parlante. He is literally king energy. Super thorough in his instruction and really funny. Assignment's instructions are hard to understand and unclear at times, but if you know what it is asking, it will literally take you 45 minutes to do the whole thing.
0	I would highly recommend taking it. It is a great intro to cs and you will learn a lot.
0	You can take this class even if you've never taken CS or aren't a CS major. Sometimes the HW questions can be hard to understand what they're asking, but Lair and SL's are extremely helpful. It's accurate to being 5 units.
0	Take it for sure regardless of what you are interested in majoring in or studying. The things you learn in this class are very applicable to the real world and it's nice to learn at least a little bit about the fundamentals of programming.
0	This course is tough, but the instruction of nick is fantastic and despite struggling through the course i enjoyed lecture a lot!
0	I would HIGHLY recommend that a student take this course. It has been my favorite class at Stanford thus far. If you do not know programming, that is okay. This class will help you. While this class can be challenging at times, there are so many wonderful resources at your disposal including TA's, office hours, LAIR, and other advanced CS students in the dorm.
0	This is probably the best-taught class I have ever taken and certainly my favorite class at Stanford so far. I had no coding experience coming into the class, but the way the class was taught was so approachable that it made me feel that I was being guided every step of the way.
0	A great intro class into CS. Stay on top of your homework and try to start it early.
0	Definitely doable.
0	Great course! Pay attention to detail during exams, small mistakes can get you docked a lot of points. get started on psets early, there's lots of resources for help but it's less stress the earlier you start. Overall, very fun to learn and empowering, especially if you haven't taken a CS course before.
0	If you have no programming experience, DONT WORRY! This class is the perfect intro - I went from nothing and feel like I'm very proficient in python. Also inspired to take 106B even though it doesn't count for my major.
0	I recommend the course if the student is interested in Computer Science. The course is very informative and one will not leave disappointed with the amount of knowledge that is gained from the course.
0	Definitely take it!
0	This is not a beginner friendly course if you tend to learn slowly. The class is fast paced and hard, but if you understand and remember everything, you will learn a lot; still, you will learn a decent amount regardless. The assignments are time consuming, but the slides/notes provided for lecture are detailed and clear to read.
0	This was such a great introduction to computer science! I loved this class and the assignments were all fun.
0	Great overview of the Python programming language. Age-old wisdom, but you get out of it what you put into it. Certainly a course that has a strong, consistent cadence. Quite easy to loose touch with the weekly rhythm and fall behind. Be diligent with keeping up with lectures.
0	I am a humanities person but still find the class to be enjoyable. This is not my first CS class, but some of the concepts still moderately challenged me. Everyone is given enough resources to succeed in the class, which I greatly appreciate.
0	I highly recommend 106A, it is structured in a way that is easy to understand both for non-CS majors and people who have never programmed before. The professors are very dynamic and great at their job. I think you will enjoy it a lot!
0	It's not too bad if you do the work - coming from someone who has never coded before!
0	If you have no coding experience, you will have to do some additional work. Clear your plate for this course because it takes a lot of your time.
0	This is a great class, and I would highly recommend!
0	Very good class, taught at a good pace but a lot of work.
0	It's a great course!
0	This class is an excellent introduction to coding. The pace is quick, but pretty easy to stay on top of. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the field of computer science.
0	I would say that if it's your first time coding, this class is great for beginners but definitely requires extra practice like going over the lessons and working over the experimental server. It's definitely doable, but LaIR is a great resource.
0	For someone who has never taken CS before, I found the class to be somewhat difficult. Be prepared to put in quite a bit of work but the end result is very rewarding.
0	CS 106a is a great course to take if you're looking for an introduction to programming. The homework takes a while to complete some weeks but if you start early and designate some time to it, you can definitely get it done early. Section can be a bit un-useful at times, but I do appreciate the section leaders' dedications to our learning. The midterms and finals can feel like a bit of a memorization game rather than a test on programming knowledge due to the fact that you don't get to run your code.
0	Take this class! As long as you don't get behind on lectures this class is very easy to succeed in, and is super cool to learn about coding.
0	Excellent course - a must-take for beginners interested in computer science!
0	Must-take for any student.  Coding python is a great skill to know and CS106A is a great, not super hard class.
0	Take it! You might find it super enjoyable. But don't start assignments too late.
0	Great class if you have no experience coding.
0	Everyone should take it.
0	very good intro class, especially if you have no experience in coding. well taught and nick makes it easy to understand
0	Good motivation to begin learning programming--I recommend doing a lot of the learning on your own and use the notes as a resource to complete the homeworks.
0	Incredible class! Very well taught, engaging, homework assignments are manageable and fun!
0	super helpful
0	The lectures were amazing and the section leaders are extremely helpful. I was not used to the fast-paced nature of the lectures and homework assignments and had a difficult time adjusting because I was taking other heavy classes. Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class.
0	Really interesting course
0	"CS106A with Nick Parlante was the perfect freshman year winter quarter experience and honestly the most organized class I have ever taken. After taking this class, I feel like I have a very thorough of understanding of Python, which I know is only the tip of the ""CS iceberg"" yet has encouraged me to sign up for CS106B in the spring and possibly continue on to a CS minor or major in the future! I am so glad I decided to take this class the time I did. It has been a LOT of time and effort on my part, but also it has been such an overwhelmingly positive experience :) I especially recommend going to all IG's offered and attending LAIR often to get your questions answered."
0	This is probably the most well-taught and easy to follow CS class at Stanford. The amount you put into the class is the amount you will get out of it. There is an option to watch the lectures online but I personally think that it is better to take the class in-person because you will retain more knowledge. Make use of the Lair office hours if you are genuinely struggling to debug a code. They WILL help you. That is all I have to say, but this class is definitely worth taking in your time at Stanford. No prior knowledge is necessary.
0	Absolutely take this class! It is a right of passage; everyone files their teeth on CS 106A. Have no previous programming experience. Nick is an extremely kind and caring instructor. Go to office hours, he wants to help and will work with you to ensure your success in the class. Everyone believes in you. You got this! I am pretty sure, behind closed doors, the lair people are selected for their ability to not only teach but uplift. Lair is an incredible resource where the student instructors radiates positivity. I had too much fun! Made so many friends while learning.
0	If you've never coded before and you're taking a heavy course load, I would say it might be a bit more difficult than what people generally say.
0	have a good time
0	This is a must take class here at Stanford. It it challenging but fun at the same time. You will learn a lot and who knows it could be something you want to pursue.
0	Watch lecture
0	It's good. Not too difficult and some parts are pretty fun. Would recommend to any Stanford student.
0	Make sure you start your assignment early!
0	Super fun, light workload.
0	Genuinely thought this class was amazing. Nick was a great lecturer and was very entertaining. Juliette was a wonderful head TA. Lectures were the perfect pace (never left feeling confused, but it wasn't boring). The course was well organized with plenty of practice problems and the homework assignments felt meaningful (I enjoyed all of them and it didn't feel like work). Prior to this class, I had never coded, but now I'm planning on taking more CS.
0	MUST TAKE
1	Keith is a fantastic teacher. His class is difficult but he lectures well and you learn a huge amount.
1	It is a step up from CS106A, but there is a lot to take from this course. I would highly recommend having a partner and to use the weekends to start the assignments.
1	Keith is a fantastic lecturer -- I found all of the lectures clear and engaging. I definitely feel like my programming skills improved alongside my logical and analytical skills.
1	This is a challenging yet excellent course that I would recommend to any student that is interested in improving their intuitions and skills in programming beyond the basics of CS106A. Just be sure to do each assignment piecemeal throughout the week as it is suggested and attend sections in order to clear any confusion on the week's material.
1	SO HARD
1	The amount you learn in 10 weeks is incredible. I came into the class having taken 106A the previous quarter,  and the first few weeks were incredibly tough because the amount of material felt overwhelming and foreign. By the end of the quarter, though, as you're putting together all that you have learned, the results are remarkable. This has been my toughest class this quarter but also my favorite class. If you love a good challenge and want to learn a ton about CS, I recommend you take this course.
1	If you are not confident with programming, by the end of this course if you put in the work and ask for help when you need it, you will find that you can utilize programming in new ways!
1	I really enjoyed it! Keith is a great lecturer and he asks very exciting questions in the homework and tests!
1	This is a fun problem-solving course, definitely harder than 106a but if you enjoy coding definitely take it. Gives a nice foundation of a lot of core coding concepts and there is a great support system.
1	big time commitment, but overall a good class and I learned a lot. Wouldn't recommend taking with a bunch of other hard classes as well though.
1	It is really fun if you enjoy CS!
1	Do it!
1	It is very hard and time consuming
1	I would say it is worth the grind! Keith's lectures are super entertaining, and I very much struggled, but it definitely built character.
1	This class is going to be tough, but there are so many resources to help you do well. The section leaders and Neel are great, and the content is really interesting. There were times where I struggled, but overall I really enjoyed it.
1	It is a big time investment but there are resources there to help alleviate some of the weight
1	You just have to be aware that this class isn't to dabble in coding or see if you like it. This is a full-fledged, complex computer science class that you have to spend time understanding and learning to love or at least like.
1	As someone who had only programmed in 106A, this course was difficult but doable. Keith is an excellent lecturer, and his psets are difficult, but you learn a lot.
1	Definitely take this class!! I took this class with Keith and it really whipped me into shape for coding. I had a lot of sleepless nights because the assignments are super hard but I know that I learned a lot.
1	This class was so hard but worth it. I learned a lot and I'm grateful for what I learned.
1	Keith is a really great lecturer but his assignments take a LOT of time so be prepared.
1	This course is amazing in that you learn so much about application of code, however with Keith, the class simply felt a bit too much. While I would understand the lectures in entirety, the assignments and midterm made me feel unconfident most times about my abilities, and really pushed me both mentally and physically to accomplish the algorithms that we had to solve. While the ideas themselves are not that difficult, it was the tiny bugs and bells-and-whistles that assignments are picky about that made me spend HOURS trying to get help on little errors and simple syntax things that I simply never knew.
1	I personally thought that this class was really well taught and that Keith is a great lecturer. I felt that I learned a lot although sometimes the class takes up a bit of time.
1	This course is the best course I've taken so far at Stanford.
1	People often like to claim that Keith is absurdly difficult. I don't think so. I don't have a huge amount of prior CS experience, but I will say that just a small amount of effort a day goes a very long way in success.
1	It is a hard course, and will challenge you a lot at times. It is also a huge step up from CS106B. But at the end it is also extremely fun, and very rewarding.
1	Be prepared to put in the work, don't take too many strenuous classes with this one
1	"If you take this course while Kieth is the lecturer, be prepared to put in a lot of effort into this class and for it to be ""the class"" of that quarter. It is a fun class with very challenging homework and exams; however, if you stay on top of lectures, homework (e.g. turning them in on time, working on them through out the week), and practicing what you learn, this can be an amazing class to have. You learn a lot, and your section leader and staff will do their best to make sure that you understand everything you need to, and if you can't, they will point you to someone else who can. It is a hard class, but I am glad that I decided to take it, and I now feel very confident in applying my thinking to future coding endeavors."
1	Keith's assignments are really well-designed, but they are difficult. Stay on top of this class.
1	Wonderful class that will challenge you but leave you a better quarter. Thankfully there are many resources (e.g. lair) to help you if you are struggling.
1	It's a very challenging class - the lectures are fun and engaging, but the PSETs will take up a huge load of your time. Probably best to take it in a lighter quarter.
1	Love this class. Cannot recommend enough.
1	This course was really challenging with Keith, he's a good lecturer but the assignments are incredibly challenging and the exams are even more difficult. Having a good hw partner is essential to doing well.
1	This class will give you a lot of experience in coding practice and teach you a lot about algorithms and different problem solving approaches. The material is generally laid out to be very accessible. Sometimes, the problem sets required a lot more effort than you were expecting, but there are resources available to you if you know where to look.
1	If you are taking it with Keith, it's not going to be easy, but it is doable. If you understand your weaknesses and work on them, and if you ask for help, you will do well.
1	Hard. definitely learned a lot tho.
1	This class was a lot of content for quarter and very fast paced but it is a good challenge if you want a very solid foundation in programming.
1	A very interesting and engaging course that teaches a lot both in Computer Science and beyond.
1	I love Keith he's hilarious and such a clear and knowledge teacher
1	Make sure you have a backup plan in case your debugger fails. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to your section leader and course staff! They're an awesome resource.
1	Tough but rewarding class. If you put in the work, you'll learn some super interesting skills and gain a deeper understanding of computers. Great class!
1	Take this class for sure but make sure you have time to dedicate to it. Also take your own notes and make sure you have an assignment partner.
1	The head TA does not respond to emails. Use edstem for any urgency in responses. Otherwise a great course that covers a lot of interesting material.
1	Definitely take it with Keith, you learn really easily in his lectures and assignments are really hard but worth it
1	"This class is one of the most well-taught classes I've ever had, not just in Stanford. The materials of this course are extremely well-organized and the instructor Keith, is one of the best teachers I've ever met in terms of teaching the materials and caring for his students. You will learn a great deal from this class. Granted, there may be hard times, especially with recursion and recursive backtracking, but you will come out of this class thinking: ""Wow! I really have become a different programmer and person."""
1	Keith's class is hard. He is a great lecturer but his assignments are just too hard and stressful. The step up from 106A to 106B is bigger than the step from no coding to 106A, so be careful. With that said, you learn a ton; if I went back, I wouldnEt take it with Keith if I had the choice. But again, I learned a lot from Keith.
2	If you are worried about the rigor of 107, or want a deeper understanding of the material, take this class! Andrew Benson is a great TA and is very very good at ensuring you have a good grasp of what's being covered that week (even if you find yourself behind on lecture).
2	Andrew is an incredibly thoughtful, intelligent, and kind instructor. Take it for access to him!
2	SOOOO helpful, literally could not imagine having taken 107 without 107A. Andrew is by far the best TA I've had.
2	Take it take it take it!!!! If you are not confident in doing well in CS107, this is the place to go. Extra office hours are more helpful than that of CS107. As a student who struggled in other infamously difficult classes, this is a life-saver. Take it with Andrew Benson if possible; he's so good at teaching and such a good person.
2	This class is a lot of work, will test your self confidence, and might make you feel like you're the only one behind. But Julie and Pat are the best instructors, the TAs are super supportive, and the final project is so fun and satisfying so ultimately this class is worth it!
2	This class is incredible. Julie and Pat are absolutely incredible professors. I learned more from this class than any other class I've taken at Stanford. As someone who normally struggles a lot more than the average Stanford student in difficult classes, I found that the content was accessible as long as I had the time to work for it, especially given that Pat and Julie care more about learning than about strict deadlines. It does take a LOT of time, though, so be prepared. There were a couple of weeks where it completely took over my life, and it felt like I had time for almost nothing else. In the end, especially after showing off my skills in the final project, I felt very rewarded, but do ensure that you take into account the workload you will be taking on.
2	This course is a great learning experience and I highly recommend it, especially if you don't have any experience with computer hardware or systems. One thing to note is that it can be quite intensive during the middle part of the quarter, so make sure to plan accordingly. The assignments are very interesting and by the end you'll have a complete suite of functionality that you can take pride in having made yourself.
2	I learned so much from this class and feel much more confident in my ability to write clean, functional and modular code. Lecture is super entertaining. Pat and Julie make lecture just the absolute best!! Aside from learning about memory, peripherals and program execution from the ground up you also get exposed to and have to learn how to use many new tools such as git, vim, GDB and the command line. Its a steep learning curve for sure and the third and fourth assignment are definitely quite challenging and tedious, however, you walk away form this class having learned so much and feeling really proud and satisfied that you actually built a computer form the ground up. If you have time you should definitely take this class!!!
2	This class is incredible!! ItEs challenging but so rewarding. ItEs one of the most engaging cs classes- everything assignment you do has a clear purpose and tangible results. It can be but its so fulfilling, and Pat and Julie are phenomenal lecturers. The tas are amazing and so available to help. Take it, you wonEt regret it.
2	This is a great class and I would highly recommend it, especially with Julie and Pat! It's a decent amount of work, but as long as you don't fall behind, its very manageable and there are a lot of resources to help you.
2	If you want to feel confident about how a computer works and how to use all manner of sensors and hardware, this is the course for you. Make sure you plan on allotting quite a bit of time for this course! It will be the main event of your term.
2	Please take the class with a friend. it can be very isolating sometime if you don't know anyone in the course.
2	This course is super fun and will give you a great community of people, but understand that part of that community is formed through shared struggle. The instructors Pat and Julie are absolutely amazing and so are the TA's but the fact is that this is just a really hard course. Plan on this course taking up the majority of your time debugging, and trying to understand the lectures and things. GO TO OFFICE HOURS and do not, I repeat, DO NOT take this class with a bunch of other time consuming classes (taking CS107E, PWR and a high level math for only 14 units may seem like a good idea but you will soon regret it).
2	Take this class, but if you aren't a top tier hacker, make it your only difficult class. I took it with CS109, an intro-sem, and a PE class, and I definitely struggled to balance my time between classes. This class was my favorite class, but my grade in CS109 definitely suffered due to my inability to walk away from my CS107E projects and equally distribute my attention. You will not want to stop working on these assignments. They are challenging but soo satisfying.
2	This class is incredible. The hardest class I took at Stanford, but also my favorite. It has been such an honor to have Pat and Julie as my professors. They are some of the most dedicated, caring professors I have ever had. Our class became such an incredible community. 107E honestly was my life this quarter, and while at times it was stressful, it was so rewarding and I wouldn't have it any other way. With this class, I would focus more on the learning than the grade. I don't think I will end up with a high grade in this class E I had a really hard time finishing the assignments E but I know that even so, I have so much to be proud of with all that I learned.
2	It's hard but rewarding. Although I am not a system person, the problems we tackle are interesting.
2	be ready for a big challenge and make sure that you allocate your time well over the course of the quarter to learning the concepts
2	Stay on top of your work and get started on assignments early because they can take a lot of time unexpectedly. As long as you keep up, you should be fine.
2	Start every assignment early
2	Very time consuming but I think the content is easier than 106B. Office hours fill up fassssst so be sure to use edstem to post questions
2	Take it! Your programming will really improve even though it is time consuming.
2	"You'll learn a lot by doing the assignments, but it is a HEAVY and challenging course. Especially for the last two assignments (Binary Bomb and Heap Allocator, Heap Allocator took me 42 hours total in week 10). Start the assignments very early and work a little each day. These are not ""due date, do date"" projects. Glad I got through it all, since I did learn a lot in the end."
2	People talk about 107 in a daunting way, but the truth is that it is a manageable class if you are willing to put in the work, struggle a little bit, and stay on top of lectures and assignments. Chris is incredibly thoughtful about the way he teaches and genuinely wants what is best for students. I would suggest taking this right after 106B. For me personally, I struggled a lot more than average in 106 and was hesitant to take this course, but I found that it wasn't an unmanageable step up. If anything, the people who had to work harder in the 106 series are used to spending more time on assignments and taking extra steps to solidify understanding - two skills that are crucial in this class.
2	Definitely plan for Assignments 5 and 6 -- they're very tough!
2	It's definitely a time-consuming class, especially including the time spent in office hours. Although the material and assignments can be challenging, it is a worthwhile experience to learn as much as you do in the span of 10 weeks. I'd highly recommend taking this course with Chris Gregg!
2	This course is very challenging and can be very rewarding, but be prepared to spend a significant amount of hours on the assignments. Do not miss lectures! This class is heavy in regards to content and hours per week so I would not recommend taking it along other difficult classes.
2	good course. get nick instead of chregg
2	Make you don't fall behind in the last 3 weeks of the class. Also, make sure you have a solid grasp of assembly code going into the final!!
2	Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the assignments... sometimes they seem simple and creep up on you.
2	It's a lot of work, but a lot of fun!
2	It takes time and patience! Office hours are very helpful, and start the assignments early. Last 2 assignments do take a lot of time.
2	This course is a rewarding course but just know it will you require you to put in a great deal of effort. The assignments are long and challenging. Best advice would be to start every assignment early.
2	Be prepared to work a lot. You have a lot less help than in 106B and the content is a lot harder. At times, this course is extremely frustrating.
2	Start the last two assignments early. The workload is heavy.
2	Chris Gregg is super understanding and encouraging. Debugging in this class can be very frustrating at times. Although this class is known to be hard, it wasn't as bad as i thought.
2	This class is a lot of work, but is also very rewarding! Your programming skills will improve a lot over the course - but I highly advise against taking the course unless you have to for your major/minor. The assignments are extremely thorough and will test your knowledge of each intricate detail. It's to the point where it can be extremely frustrating where a small detail throws everything off. Additionally, Office Hours can be completely useless at times, with there being extremely few TAs and sometimes dozens of students in the queue. The TAs themselves are super helpful, but getting access to them can be nearly impossible at times, and it can often feel like you're on your own. But overall, the course content is extremely interesting and engaging. But the assignments (looking at you, heap allocator) can be extremely tedious and time consuming. Budget your time accordingly!
2	Take it! Chris is so kind and understanding and everything is very well taught
2	Not certain how it is with other professors, but Piech's 109 is masterfully crafted. Great Psets in a great new pset app, solid lectures, good sections with helpful problems, and you feel supported throughout. Be prepared to put in a bit more time towards end of quarter w/ machine learning. Highly recommend
2	Take this class, and take it with Chris Piech. THIS MAN IS JOY INCARNATE and an incredible lecturer. He will make you love probability as much as he does, and be understanding and compassionate throughout the quarter while still challenging you intellectually. The teaching team is awesome and constantly thinking of ways to improve the students' experience in the class. There really isn't much else to say!
2	This class is great! Chris is amazing and such a good professor. I wasn't really looking forward to this class, but I absolutely loved it with Chris and the things we learn are SO applicable to real life.
2	extremely time consuming but very much doable even if you are worried about CS/math, course staff is very helpful, just make sure to put in the work
2	CS 109 is almost like a review if you have taken AP Stats or Econ 102A beforehand. The machine learning part in the end goes very fast, however, and I honestly donEt think I learned it well. This is why you should go to lecture!
2	Chris Piech is the BEST. The course is alright, but having a great instructor like Chris makes it one of my favorite classes at Stanford so far. The TAs all reflect Chris's energy and make learning that much more enjoyable. Pay attention to lectures and USE THE READER (it's very well organized) and you should be fine.
2	I tell most people to take the course, its a great staff and a great course
2	If you've taken AP stats its a bit of a walk in the park, pay attention after the midterm tho
2	very cool class
2	Chris Piech is by far the best CS lecturer. I've had Chris Gregg, Keith Schwarz, Parlante, and Troccoli, and Chris tops all of them. His positive energy is so infectious, and how excited he is on a constant basis about the material makes you as excited about it too. If it weren't for him, I definitely would've hated CS109.
2	Love love love this class- Chris Piech is the best and all the TAs are so genuinely nice and helpful
2	This course is great!! I feel like I've learned so much and Chris was an amazing lecturer.
2	Prof Piech, if you can take the course with him, is incredibly kind, supportive, and dedicated to making the course a good experience for students. The emphasis on modeling machine learning towards the end of the course is really neat, and youEll walk away with an appreciation for how probability factors into your life :)
2	My favorite class this quarter. The teaching team is so passionate about improving the experience for the students, to the point of building and constantly revising an entirely new app for problem sets and colearning. I highly recommend this to not only the people who have to take it for core major requirements but also anyone interested in understanding probability as it applies to our lives, and how to utilize it effectively with all of the power of computation!
2	I recommend this course. I learned a lot and never felt like I was falling majorly behind. The teaching staff was always prepared to answer questions.
2	Chris is a great professor who cares a lot about his students and their learning.
2	I highly recommend CS109 with Chris Piech. Dr. Piech made class exciting and fun, and the maxim that learning is a fundamental joy really shines through both lectures and conversations with Dr. Piech. Office hours were perhaps too quick to just give the answers away, but overall I felt very supported. Comparatively much easier course than CS103.
2	I procrastinated taking CS 109 because I expected it to be a really terrible class, but I was pleasantly surprised. The content was interesting, the problem sets were useful, and the midterm exam was pretty generous (the final may be a different story, however). I didn't have to watch lectures until the machine learning module, since the course reader, sections, and automatic feedback for psets helped me learn the material.
2	Take it! Piech is an amazing teacher.
2	If you want to start thinking of probability in a practical manner beyond just theory, this is the class to take.
2	Don't fall behind!
2	Enthusiastic teaching by Chris Piech so it made the content much more easy to understand and process, very thorough and I enjoyed his breakdown of concepts and connections to real-world concepts as well
2	This is probably the best introductory class to probability. Chris is a fantastic teacher and makes even the most sophisticated material a piece of cake. There is so much that you can learn from this class.
2	Take this course. It's an amazingly well-taught crash course in probability. You will leave it feeling totally versed in an extremely powerful and applicable knowledge area.
2	This is an excellent introduction to probability and how it applies to computer science. Learning about the theory behind machine learning is very rewarding, and I highly recommend this course. Just make sure not to fall behind, because the material moves quickly.
2	AMAZING!! Chris is incredible and the class is great.
2	Take ace! Ian is such a great instructor who can break down the same idea and explain it in so many ways. He writes beautiful section questions with detailed solutions. He has industry experience which is a plus. HeEs knowledgeable about many things beyond CS109 stuff. IEm so glad I had him as a resource.
2	Absolutely take it, especially if Ian is teaching it. He is one-of-a-kind. He is so patient with his students, and he words his answers so carefully to make sure he is giving you the right information in a way that you can digest it. He will be an AMAZING lecturer one day, and Stanford would be SO LUCKY to have him as a full-time faculty.
1	CS103 is a great course & Cynthia is a wonderful professor!
1	This course will have you thinking about math in a very different way if you've never taken a theory class before. The grading can be very detail-oriented for the proofs so make sure you follow the templates and the rules that are clearly laid out for you. Office hours are very hard to get into because they fill up quickly so be the first one there, or ask questions on Ed. It's very convenient that the lectures are recorded so you can watch them at your own pace. Working together with a PSET partner is very beneficial, so make sure you find a good partner and also do some of the work for each problem.
1	Amazing, satisfying, don't believe the hype that it's super hard/sucks or something like that. so glad I took this!
1	You must start PSETs early and use office hours.
1	This course is one of the most well organized courses I've taken at Stanford. The course material requires you to think, but as long as you pay attention in lecture and be precise, you can do very well!  It also requires you to think a bit differently than other CS classes, so it's very interesting material for someone like me who is new to it!
1	Amazing course, definitely worth teaching. Cynthia makes sure this course is extremely well organized, and the content is very applicable in future courses (e.g. CS161).
1	Take it! The teaching team is fantastic and the material is really interesting! Definitely challenging but there is so much support and the lectures are an amazing resource
1	Great class! Cythnia teaches the concepts very well and makes it easy for me to understand even though I had no prior experience with proofs.
1	I would say this course, apart from being an excellent background for theoretical CS and any sort of proof-writing, is a very well-taught and well-organized course. It does a great job developing not only your ability to think critically, but also to think creatively and solve problems.
1	It is a fun class if you like logic puzzles. Be sure to strictly adhere to the specific format/syntax presented in lecture, as the teaching staff marks down for not doing so.
1	I actually really enjoyed this course. Definitely make use of office hours as much as possible and you will be fine. It is a very formulaic class in that once you determine the write approach style you are fine.
1	Take it if you are new to proof-based math or if you suspect you will need extra help in the course. At the very least, it is great one-on-one time to ask a TA questions!
1	Very great teacher
2	Great class. Very important content. Professors very hit or miss but that's unavoidable. Just learn the content and you'll do fine.
2	This course has very interesting material and the problems that your are solving are genuinely engaging. However, i think the administration of the course was a bit off this year. The cheating scandal disrupted the flow of things, making it so that we didn't receive feedback on the last three assignments before the final. Of course I understand that the TAs would have to go through every single midterm to check for signs of Honor Code violations. However, this came at the expense of all students. I felt like online office hours were really helpful with the PSETs and understanding material. In person office hours felt a bit more disjointed which was weird. One other thing that I didn't really like was the amount of hand-waving during proofs, which made it a bit more difficult to understand the reasoning behind certain algorithms. This does make it easier for us to digest content, but made it a bit harder to study for the exam where its unclear what information we need to know. The exams are difficult, but they can be difficult for everyone. Remember that its okay not to know everything on the exam and you can still do fine! Just try to actively enjoy the material and talk to the TAs/professors if you have questions.
2	"I didn't expect this class to be as bad as it was - I'm a CS major and I feel like I had heard a lot more hype about CS 107/110 compared to 161. TLDR is that the instructors for the winter are super smart and accomplished in the field, but they don't necessarily understand what it's like to be a student learning these algorithms for the first time and can have a hard time explaining them to someone who doesn't have a background in theoretical math. The psets were very proof/math heavy, so ironically the algorithm design portion of the class was comparatively much easier. I think I will use at least the algorithms portion of the class, but the ratio of ""stuff I will use"" vs ""this isn't useful in practice"" wasn't great.Jose was an incredible section leader and did a great job translating the lectures into concepts a normal person could understand - I wish he had been the one teaching the class! He always would take time before/after section to answer student questions to ensure everyone felt supported. Additionally, he went above and beyond in writing up super helpful guides for various concepts in the class and posting them on Ed.I was very disappointed and frustrated in how the teaching team handled the large amount of cheating on our take-home midterm. We didn't get statistics on how many people cheated, but anecdotally I've heard it was like 25%, which is a significant number of people given the class has around 500 people. They provided an alternative grading scheme that basically made it so that the people who cheated could retract their exams without any grade penalty whatsoever, which sends the message that it's OK to cheat so long as you come clean if you get caught. This class is graded on a curve and as someone who didn't cheat, it's frustrating to know that people literally got ahead at the expense of others and the teaching team seemed to send a message that this was acceptable."
2	This class is well taught and there are a lot of resources for doing well. The midterm+final format is a lot less stressful than the weekly quiz format offered in other quarters.
2	"You're probably taking this because you have to. I would recommend not taking it with anything else that's difficult. The assignments are extremely long - at some points, I found myself working for 15 hours straight and sometimes through the night on one problem. The TAs do their best, but sometimes they're confused too, and that's not very heartening. Some of the simpler concepts are explained over and over, while the more complex concepts get sped through in one lecture, but still appear on the assignments and exams. I think the toughest thing this quarter was the midterm being ""designed"" for 3 hours but actually taking me all 48 hours of the time it was available to complete. It's unfortunate because I do find the content interesting, but I don't feel like it was taught in a way that I could keep up."
2	This course was not my thing. I found it rather boring but the class is well structured and run well.
2	If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to for your major so I don't know if anything I say here matters. It's a very tough but doable class.
2	Fun class!
2	Moses and Nima are good people, but easily the worst computer science teachers I have had so far (compared to Piech, Kieth, Chris Gregg, Troccoli, etc.). It just seems like they don't really care about teaching as much. Sometimes they don't really even know what's gunna pop up on the next slide, as they don't make their own. Also, the lectures just do not prepare you for the homework; they skip the most important slides and just never show you how to do things that you need to do. Anyways, you have to take it so I'm just ranting. Have fun.
2	This is an interesting but tough class. I did well in the pre-reqs but found this to be the hardest class conceptually in the core. There's a problem or two on every PSET that are near-unsolvable without going to OH, so if you want to minimize your time in the class, definitely make use of it. That said, the whole point of the class is that you are able to come up with algorithms for tough problems, so if you want to make the most of the class, try to only go to OH once you're really stuck; for the few topics I went to OH on after only working on a problem for a couple hours, I ended up not being able to figure out related problems on my own on the midterm/final. All in all, it's a good class, but beware that the lectures don't prepare you to solve all the problems like they largely did in CS 103, so try to find a good balance between grit and seeking help at OH.
2	Try hard to go to office hours for the PSET and watch youtube videos if you don't understand a specific algorithm in lecture. This class is a marathon so don't get too burnt out at the beginning even though the psets then are very hard.
2	Most of the work in this class are the PSETs. Make sure to start them early, and refer to lecture notes often when you are stuck.
2	Can be a lot, but just go to office hours a lot to get traction!
2	Honestly don't take this unless it's taught better
2	I would recommend as a follow up to CS103
2	It is definitely a challenging course but will be rewarding in the end. Utilize office hours and don't fall behind on lectures.
2	Good class to learn algorithms and problem solving techniques, but just be aware that class averages for assignments/exams are super high
2	Wonderful class. Highly recommend.
2	Challenging course but better if you attend in person and use all of the resources they give to you!
2	Very neat content. This course is one of those that its either you already have the intuition or you don't. If you have the intuition for many problems it makes the course easier and if you don't it takes time to build it but it is not impossible. Take advantage of office hours and help from the TA's. They all really want to help you and don't be afraid to ask questions.
2	0
2	161 is a pretty tough class, but you probably knew that already. The teaching staff is okay, but they rush through some harder topics it feels. A lot of the learning and aha moments have to be done yourself. Midterm was brutal. psets can be okay, but some unfair questions every now and then that just destroy a week.Take with caution.
2	Difficult class
2	The class is hard to get a good grade because the medium score is so high. Go to the office hours and check the answer with your friends.
2	The lectures are super clear and well organized. I thought that Nima and Moses are both clear and conscientious instructors. However, the homeworks can be unnecessarily long and vague, and the TAEs are not always prepared to concisely explain topics.
2	Fast-paced class, but very worth it
2	Make sure you review the slides after lecture, and if you watch recorded lectures asynchronously, pause to check your understanding. The midterm and final are very tough.
2	This is a tricky course. There is a lot of content and the midterm and final are definitely hard. It is doable if you keep up with lecture, go to office hours and read the lecture notes.
2	"Take it if you have to. Moses and Nima seem like great people, but they (especially Nima) are not great at teaching. Nima in particular will waffle a lot and tell you to ""convince yourself that it is true"" for the material that you came to class to learn. The ethics lectures are poorly integrated as well - they just felt like extra work and they didn't really relate to the things that we were learning. We could have been looking at examples of how algorithms had led to ethical issues, but we didn't. The problem sets are also often confusingly worded and require a lot of time in office hours to solve."
2	Start the homeworks ASAP, budget your time out, and stay caught up on lectures, or you will find the second half of the class very difficult
2	Please attend OHs, and go to section. It'll make things easier.
2	Great course, Moses is an awesome lecturer. Content is definitely useful and applicable, but unless you have prior experience in algorithms don't take it your freshman year.
2	You have to take it for the CS major, but if you're anything like me, you won't like it. I felt incredibly reliant on office hours to make any progress on the problem sets, and the take-home midterm they said should take 3 hours took me the whole two days it was out for. The TAs (especially Jose & Jerry) were amazing though, and I think Moses and Nima were good lecturers too. I personally just found the content very difficult and uninspiring.
2	Terrible experience all around. Some of the psets were so tedious and long, even with partners it was difficult to finish. Midterm was so ridiculously difficult that allegedly half the class retracted the test. And the final was tough (not comparable to the practice exams from in-person quarters which were in comparison very doable), though this was expected since they probably wanted to punish the people who retracted the midterm. Ed responsiveness is also lower than most other core classes.Only mild positive is that the lectures were pretty good (albeit rushed at the end at times - Moses is the better lecturer of the two), and Jerry and Jose's backs are frickin yoked from carrying the entire TA team. If you ever go to office hours and it's not one of them hosting it, the TA will tell you to just make a post on Ed and wait for Jerry, Jose, or Moses to respond, pretty much the only 3 helpful people among the staff. Rest of the TAs are incredibly unhelpful.
2	If you are not planning on majoring in CS or taking advanced courses in analysis of algorithms I don't think this class is necessary. It covers some interesting algorithms, but not from a programming approach.
2	The slides for this class are helpful and the sections are very helpful as well.
2	The course is very well taught and the TAs are incredible.  Moreover, all the knowledge gained is very practical - you learn problem solving skills.
2	nothing
2	Another great class by the CS department. Really cool to see how a lot of these work. Take if you enjoy problem solving/puzzles.
2	This is probably the worst class in the CS core I've taken. Moses is a good instructor but Nima's lectures are very confusing and hard to follow. Additionally, the teaching staff are very disorganized and often not on the same page about PSET problems and expectations -- of the office hours available, only a few TA's actually can explain the material and meaningfully help with the PSETs (shoutout to Goli for being an amazing TA!). The exams were terribly organized as well - the take home midterm was unreasonably long and took the whole 48 hour window. Meanwhile, the final didn't resemble any of the practice tests and had very hard questions.
2	Go to office hours and engage with other students!
2	Go to office hours. The grading is very harsh and you're unlikely to do well without attending office hours and getting clarification from a TA on the expected answers and what is needed to fulfill the rubric. A small mistake could cost you a lot of marks as there's almost no credit given for partial solutions. Also, make sure you stay on top of the forums, often the homework questions are unclear, and you might need to rewrite your solutions after the clarifications are posted.
2	Lots of resources from the staff. Midterm can be very hard. Instructors are good at presenting different topics however HW instructions can be ambiguous at times.
2	Good course, definitely take it
2	CS 161 can be a great class. Just dont take it with moses or nima.
2	This course is awesome and perfect in so many ways. Highly recommend it to anyone interested in fundamental algorithmic design.
2	Great course for algorithms intro.
2	It's taught fine, but the psets are inordinately time-consuming.
2	It's a lot of work, and the paradigms are among the most beautiful things I've ever learned.

2	Great and interesting material. Course is well established with great lecture notes, which makes learning the material easier. Course instructors are not the most pleasant people, but TAs are wonderful.
2	This class is hard. Make sure you go to office hours. Ask questions. This will get you through the homework. The exams are a different question. You just have to do a lot of practice. They are really challenging.
2	ouch
2	This class is well taught and there are a lot of resources for doing well. The midterm+final format is a lot less stressful than the weekly quiz format offered in other quarters.
2	An extreme, ridiculous amount of work.
2	This is a challenging but very rewarding course. The skills you learn will also help you succeed in algorithmic interview questions.
2	You probably have to take it for your major anyways.  If you don't there's not too much of a point.
2	Start the homeworks early, go to office hours
2	CS 161 has the potential to be an unbelievably interesting class. Unfortunately, the winter quarter offering fell short of that. I found the instruction under Professor Charikar to be very solid, while I found myself learning less in Professor Anari's lectures. The homework assignments were long and quite challenging, and while I learned a lot from many of the problems, I feel like they could have been shorter. The take-home midterm was borderline madness E the professors designed a test that many of my classmates could not finish after 12 hours of work, and a sginificant number of students cheated on it. The final was difficult, but much more fair / doable.
2	Just a really poorly run class. Almost half of our psets (3/8) were ungraded at the time of the final. The instructors would refuse to offer in-depth explanations to practice final questions on Ed and instead suggest that another student step up and explain it... days before the final. Answer keys were often unreliable and riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. Some answers were clearly written by TAs without a very strong grasp on the topic. Oh, and the midterm was by far the most unreasonable exam I've ever seen at Stanford, even though it was take-home! Don't take unless it's mandatory, and even then I wouldn't suggest taking it with Moses/Nima.
2	A ton of work. Instructors are very kind and office hours were key in understanding applications of the material.
2	Difficult class
2	Great course but very time-consuming! Start psets early and go to office hours. Exams are very tough.
2	Don't take this class unless you have to (aka CS majors). Moses and Nima are OK at teaching the material. Homeworks were really hard, and you basically couldn't figure out half the problems without relying on office hours. The midterm was also really hard; it was open for a 48 hour period and meant to take 3 hours, but it took me about 15 hours and there were still problems I didn't know how to do. The final was also pretty hard but at least it was an in person 3-hour sitting, which was much preferred over the format of the midterm. This class honestly sucks a lot, but you have to do it. If you're deciding to take it with Aviad or with Moses and Nima, I'd say that taking it with Moses and Nima is slightly better, but you're still going to have to work hard. Go to office hours and sections to help you get through the homeworks. Exams are pretty hit or miss.
2	"I did not enjoy this class with Nima and Moses. I think the lectures were great and the material was fine; in fact, the course provides some of the most applicable skills out of the introductory CS courses. But we never really got to see the true power of the course material in assignments. Every problem in every assignment was some contrived task involving anthropomorphic animals that didn't resemble anything we could actually encounter in real life. They were super uninspiring and felt more tedious than anything else. I rarely felt algorithmically challenged, and most of my time was spent trying to make minor, materially inconsequential modifications to some algorithmic idea to account for edge cases. Grading was also tough---I often suffered a ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" by getting a few points off on multiple questions for minor or unspecified errors---but as long as you put in some work you should be fine."
2	This class is not easy. It's a lot of content in a little amount of time, but you do come out of the class learning a lot. The homeworks and exams can be very difficult, whether it is beneficial to our learning isn't too clear, but you will manage.
2	Make sure you review the slides after lecture, and if you watch recorded lectures asynchronously, pause to check your understanding. The midterm and final are very tough.
2	Not a great class. Only take it if you absolutely have to (in which case I feel sorry for you).
2	The lectures are really good, and the concept checks are very challenging but low-stakes (because you won't be graded for them). Algorithms is as much an art as it is a science, so it shouldn't be surprising to find the first few psets to be very hard. In particular, the second problem set is the rite of passage, so watch out!
2	This is a no-nonsense class as introduction to algorithms and algorithmic analysis. Much of the work is straightforward from what's learned, but be prepared to think.
2	Please attend OHs, and go to section. It'll make things easier.
2	This class is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken at Stanford. I required office hours to do every problem set but the TAs are great and so supportive. Be prepared for VERY hard exams. The lecture's aren't super well taught but if you are confused about concepts there are more than enough office hours and sections to get your questions answered.
2	A pretty hard class. A mix of 106b and 103. Midterm, which was take-home, was really hard. I felt it was a bad idea to assign it on weekdays, which meant that if you had classes during those days, you'd be at a disadvantage. Probably very useful for interviews (the 106b material makes a lot more sense when they get a mathematical treatment). Second half with graphs and dynamic programming is imo harder than the first half, which is mainly just 106b review. It's a cs core class, so you have to take it. Nima and Moses are alright.
2	asf
2	Terrible experience all around. Some of the psets were so tedious and long, even with partners it was difficult to finish. Midterm was so ridiculously difficult that allegedly half the class retracted the test.

Rest of the TAs are incredibly unhelpful.
2	Quality class, a lot of work goes into the labs and staying ahead. Not hard to catch up but wouldn't recommend falling behind.
2	If you are not planning on majoring in CS or taking advanced courses in analysis of algorithms I don't think this class is necessary. It covers some interesting algorithms, but not from a programming approach.
2	Pros: This class is very helpful if you're a CS major going for SWE. Technical interviews feel way easier after taking 161. Plus, algorithms are pretty fundamental to CS in general. You'll feel a lot more confident with CS after this class. Plus, the PSETs often feel like solving puzzles, so if you enjoy that, you should enjoy the problem sets. Lastly, the TAs are amazing. Cons: This class is incredibly difficult. Sometimes, the lectures feel like they are jumping around and skipping steps (took with Moses and Nima). Definitely be ready to put in time and effort to succeeding in this class.
2	Take this class.
2	really important and helpful class, it will help you design much more efficient code
2	Great course that helps you develop a new way of thinking. Definitely go to section, and start early on the homework and assessments. Section leaders and teaching team were fantastic and very helpful throughout.
2	This class was a traumatic experience from start to finish. The TAs for this course are incompetent at best and actually offer conflicting information on the problem sets. I find it truly strange that the TAs themselves don't seem to be on the same page at all on the problems, so I don't understand how the course staff expect the students to come up with the correct solution. With the exception of a couple TAs, most TAs are also very reluctant to give out solutions, which I totally understand, but it starts to get ridiculous when even basic questions go unanswered and it feels like you cannot get any help at all. The problem sets themselves are long and arduous, and quite frankly very difficult to complete without going to OH weekly multiple times--you need to have flashes of intuition which is tricky to develop. I would basically sit in OH all week and hope that TAs gave out some nuggets of information. Moses' lecturing was alright but Nima's was often scattered and left me more confused than when I started. The content is already difficult to begin with, so the lackluster lecturing certainly does not help. The midterm was also startlingly long (although it was supposed to take 3 hours, which was a complete lie) and I imagine the final will be a similar situation. Overall, this class has significantly dampened my mental health this quarter and I cannot wait for this experience to be over. If you're a CS major, you have to take this course (which I do believe is the hardest of the CS core, even more so than 110), so I just grit your teeth and try to get through it.
2	This is probably the worst class in the CS core I've taken. Moses is a good instructor but Nima's lectures are very confusing and hard to follow. Additionally, the teaching staff are very disorganized and often not on the same page about PSET problems and expectations -- of the office hours available, only a few TA's actually can explain the material and meaningfully help with the PSETs (shoutout to Goli for being an amazing TA!). The exams were terribly organized as well - the take home midterm was unreasonably long and took the whole 48 hour window. Meanwhile, the final didn't resemble any of the practice tests and had very hard questions.
2	Go to office hours. The grading is very harsh and you're unlikely to do well without attending office hours and getting clarification from a TA on the expected answers and what is needed to fulfill the rubric. A small mistake could cost you a lot of marks as there's almost no credit given for partial solutions. Also, make sure you stay on top of the forums, often the homework questions are unclear, and you might need to rewrite your solutions after the clarifications are posted.
2	This is by far the worst CS class I have taken at Stanford. If you have any option at all, I would do everything and anything I can to avoid taking this course, including changing your major. It is an absolute shame Stanford put this in the CS core, and until they re-imagine the class or change the CS core requirements, I wouldn't recommend being a CS major or CS masters student. The instruction was very poor, the class was boring and there was no clear use for the majority of the content. I have been in industry for almost 10 years, and we didn't cover a single thing that would've come in handy to me. Additionally, the professors created many situations that incentivized cheating, meaning those of us that take the honor code seriously were at a stark disadvantage.
2	I have a love-hate relationship with this class. in summary, this is the hardest class I've ever taken not only because the content is difficult to learn and to teach but mainly because the class was so unorganized. One main frustration is going to office hours where TAs are missing this happened to me three times, and I've heard of other students who would go to office hours and no TA would show up as well. Two main improvements the class can make are focusing the lectures on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information. Instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini-quizzes to replace the midterm and final.I liked the content and found it interesting and overall I think I will get a good grade because I sacrificed a sufficient amount of my time and mental health to perform well on the psets and exams. However, the whole process was more difficult than it needed to be because the lectures just aren't very understandable and you have to do a lot of teaching your self the content and the exam logistics/office hours/TAs/and grading process as a whole are very unorganized and could be vastly improved to create a better experience for the TAs and the students.The midterm was absurdly long and difficult. It was essentially a pset and so many students cheated a new grading scheme had to be created. I believe this mess could've been avoided if instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini quizzes that don't could for as much of our grade and figuring out a way to make the homework more digestible and aligned with what we learned in class. I often couldn't complete the homework on my own and had to go to office hours to try to figure out where to start. I found Jose's office hours the most helpful because he would break the problem down and help us think through the problem whereas other TAs often would circumvent my question or in the process of trying to avoid saying to much about the homework they would leave me more confused than I began. Additionally, it seemed like each TA had different approaches to the problem because there were instances where I would ask TAs certain questions about the homework but get marked down for reasons I was told by another TA we're okay. I understand this content is difficult to teach but I often learned little from lectures and other TAs and instead relied on grinding by myself, Jose's office hours, and talking through content with my peers. I think the professor and teaching team need to take a hard look at this class to re-evaluate what is the most important info to share during lecture to help students understand the concepts and how the teaching team can put themselves in the student's shoes and remember what it was like learning this content for the first time so that they can break it down in a way that makes sense for new learners.For instance, I stopped watching lectures and would just walk through the slides at my own pace to learn concepts from a lecture because the lecture went too fast and didn't explain everything. Specifically the hashing lecture I remember that one being very dense. I would prefer covering less content but understanding the content covered rather than blowing through content. I think a lot of the lectures should focus on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information.For instance, maybe cover certain topics in lecture so students understand and then make supplemental videos where you break down the more complicated advanced topics you would want to cover but didn't have time for. This way students can review on their own time since students are already reviewing the content on their own time anyway.
2	CS 161 can be a great class. Just dont take it with moses or nima.
2	Find a good TA who will carry you through. Find a supportive group of people to work with. This class is very, very challenging and the psets will not be a good time. That being said, if you put in the time, you'll learn a lot! The content is actually very interesting and relevant to technical coding interviews.
2	Great course for algorithms intro.
2	This class is literally the only reason I got through 161. Avery is the most dedicated TA I've had in my 3 years studying CS at Stanford, and not only went above and beyond to provide us with help and resources but also did an amazing job supporting us as humans. I was nervous about how the 2 hour section would add to my workload for the quarter, but the time was insanely productive in helping me understand the material and apply it on the homeworks; I always looked forward to section. He was also super responsive to student feedback and was genuinely committed to tailoring his teaching to our particular class cohort. I felt like I had a community and a support group, which I really needed in 161. If you are in doubt, TAKE THIS CLASS!
2	This course is super interesting if you like math. Be aware that it is extremely fast paced though, so you must stay on top of your work.
2	Excellent introductory linear algebra course with special topics
2	It's a fast-paced class, but if you take the time to understand the concepts, you'll honestly be fine. If you get behind, you're going to be confused and overwhelmed pretty fast. There are so many resources for this class, so make sure to use them. Textbook is super well written and aligns with the class really well, but it's at times dense and has too much unnecessary information (as any textbook does). Gene's annotated notes were a life saver. Final was way harder than the midterms, so help your future self out by doing well on the first two tests.
2	Make sure you start the homework as soon as possible, do not wait until the last minute.
2	It's hard and the pace is super fast, but it's doable as long as you dedicate the time to reading the textbook and trying to understand the material.
2	Difficult and very fast paced but you learn a lot. Take with Gene if possible,
2	"This course is by no means ""easy,"" but I would recommend it to everyone at Stanford. Even if you are majoring in English or Art Practice, you should still seize the opportunity to take this class while you can. In a way, you learn all the math you ever have before college in ten weeks, from adding to graphing representations of 3 dimensional figures, but through the perspective of vectors which are honestly just super cool. Even if you hate math, you should want to know the things taught in this course, or at least, appreciate them a little more. It can be a lot of work, but its worth it."
2	Math 51 is one of those required classes that most students end up taking before they graduate. While challenging, the material itself can be interesting, particularly if well taught. It would be better with a recorded component.
2	A challenging but rewarding course. It was really well taught.
2	Great class, Gene Kim is a great instructor. (Gene please give me an A on the final)
2	Put in the time and youEll be rewarded
2	After taking 21, 51 was not bad at all. The lesson notes and textbooks are well organized and easy to follow. I even enjoyed the class slightly!
2	Highly recommend this class to everyone. The understanding of linear algebra you will gain will have applicable across majors. The course is extremely well organized and very manageable if you take it the way it's designed.
2	Math 51 is definitely doable, but it will take a lot of commitment. Start the homeworks early and find an effective study partner / group.
2	It's a pretty manageable class
2	Interesting but very fast paced and feels like a 7 unit class. Don't recommend taking other hard classes when taking this class.
2	This class is definitely tough, but doable if you put in the effort. However, the math department isn't really flexible even with those who were exposed to COVID.
2	This is a challenging course but an essential one to take.
2	Do the textbook reading and make sure you understand the concepts after each and every lecture because the content moves very fast. Also work through the homework early and as you go because doing problems will help you understand the book to a greater extent.
2	The professors and TA's teaching and organization of the course is done well. However, the class is taught at such an intense pace that it doesn't much matter. Unless you're taking a very light course load, find mathematics extremely easy, or took some form of multivariable calculus or linear algebra in the past, it's very hard to keep up in this class. At other schools, learning multivariable calculus and linear algebra in the span of ten weeks sounds insane. This class feels like more than five units. Every lecture covers so much material and every lecture builds upon the previous lectures, so it's very easy to fall behind, at which point it's even harder to catch up. This class is required for a lot of STEM majors, so find comfort in the fact that many students have to take it and you'll probably have a lot of friends or dormmates to struggle through the course with and study with. Don't do this class alone, find others to do homework with. Good luck.
2	Don't shy away from Math 51 - I've learned more than I have in any math class and gained a much deeper appreciation for the subject. If you can stay on top of content (take notes on every pre reading, complete all discussion worksheets, understand the homework), which is not an easy task, you will get a good grade. That said, a strong foundation in math, particularly with math without a calculator, is crucial. Math 21 material isn't as relevant, but Calc (derivatives), Algebra II (comfort with factoring large polynomials) and PreCalc (hyperbolas, ellipses, trig) comes in handy a lot. The only thing that I think is slightly unfair about the class is that I almost ran out of time on every midterm / final.
2	The textbook is the best math textbook I've ever used
2	Definitely a tough class to take. Make sure you start each section of your problem sets immediately after its corresponding lectures so you don't fall too far behind in the class.
2	Be ready for this class. It will not be easy to understand the material right from the textbook or the lectures. Stay up to date, go to the numerous office hours and SUMO tutoring sessions for help. Do PSETs with your friends and make sure to do them early. Start the weekend before or better yet do the chapter's problems right after the lecture. The content itself isn't difficult, but it will take time and help from others to master!
2	Very interesting! I will say I'm more of a math nerd, but thought that it was very well taught and helped apply difficult concepts to each other and outside of math.
2	some people find this class extremely difficult. i was one of those people. don't expect a lot of content overlap between this and calc bc. it is entirely new content. if you have the skills and determination to succeed in this class, it is possible to do so, but be prepared to really work for it and put in a lot of time on your own outside of class because you will undoubtedly find the instruction somewhat lacking.
2	This has easily been the best math class I have taken at Stanford. Any chance you have to take a math class with Mark Lucianovic instead of another professor, TAKE IT. He's phenomenal. (If you're picking between CME 100 and Math 51, pick 51!)
2	This is a great course that you will almost certainly have to take.
2	Theoretically, the course content is not that hard. However, the textbook/lectures can make the content a little confusing, so ask questions! Every lecture also goes overtime, so keep that in mind when scheduling other classes. I highly recommend finding a good section leader who will reteach lecture content in section. Lastly, if you have to isolate for any reason, it is important to know that lectures are not recorded and they will not Zoom you in. It's up to you to learn the material on your own if you miss lecture/section!
2	I would recommend to take advantage of office hours and review sessions but also to read the textbook as it is written very well.
2	It's Math 51. Not much left to add to what's already been said. Although it's an unpopular ranking, I would rank the lecturers in the following order: Mark>Jinyoung>Gene. Mark explains the concepts and intuition behind what we're learning a lot better than the other two lecturers. Jinyoung goes through examples in the clearest way and she is great at answering questions and overall being really supportive. Gene goes through a ton of examples in lecture and he wrote the exams in my quarter so he would give some insights that the other profs wouldn't. He was also the only lecturer that would post their annotated notes; he's a legend for that. Overall the course covers so much content and I struggled finding motivation to finish all the psets but the linear algebra is interesting and satisfying when you understand it. It's part of the stanford experience, don't hesitate to take it. Just get it over with.
2	Lucianovic is a really nice guy, but it's not rare that he doesn't make it all the way through the lecture notes. You'll have to teach yourself a lot of the material, but the psets are honestly really helpful and the textbook is probably the best math textbook I've ever had -- conveys the important material well, lowkey funny at times, has great resources for studying. I didn't have any multivar or linear algebra experience coming into this class and it honestly wasn't too bad, although the final did kick my butt.
2	Goodluck
2	I think we spent too much time on the basics, but then again people are coming from different backgrounds. Did not like the homework because it was very computation heavy, and there'd be several problems of the exact same type given to us. Overall a good and manageable course as advertised, learnt very helpful linear algebra. Read section worksheet solutions; those are most helpful when it comes to reviewnig for exams.
2	Math 51 is a great class. If you stay on top of the reading and engage with lecture it feels fairly doable. The textbook is incredibly well written and thorough and really complements the examples given in lecture (take with Gene Kim if you want very example heavy lectures).
2	I really did like the way the book was written and the way Gene Kim (my professor) interacted with students and made topics accessible to us.
2	The content in this class is extremely useful. However, it is quite challenging and you may find yourself spending hours a week studying only to scrape by on each exam.
2	This course is extremely fast paced. We covered about a chapter a lecture and sometimes 2 chapters. The tests are very challenging and even if you feel like you understand the concepts that doesn't mean you'll be able to answer the questions.
2	Don't take it unless you have to. Interesting stuff, but too much content in too little time.
2	Difficult class but had to do it for a major requirement
2	MATH 51 is MATH 51 -- the beginning of the course was very confusing, the second part was understandable, and the end expanded greatly on previous knowledge. The teaching quality is okay, but zero accommodations were made for me when I tested positive for COVID. The lectures aren't recorded, but the annotated notes usually suffice. However, be aware that many of the annotated notes have typos and wrong math in them.
2	Gene Kim was a good lecturer. Interesting class with wide-applications.
2	If you want to obtain a good grade in Math 51 is definitely a strong 5 units. The instruction is fine, but you will have to do a lot of the learning yourself outside of class. Homework is application of theory learned in class to problems rather than just learning how to work through problems. Section is not mandatory, but can be helpful some weeks.
2	Learn to use outside resources, kahn academy, etc. The teachers are pretty good but the class moves so fast that if you are not solid on one topic while its being taught in class/ going over it in discussion, the class will move on anyways and not mention the topic again. It will only come up later on a midterm/final.
2	Challenging but very rewarding class! Will learn alot! Go to Jinyoung's lecture!!!!
2	As someone not confident in math, this class felt like 8 units. Also donEt get behind. Ever.
2	I learned a ton about linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and general math skills form this course. While it is a lot of work, the course is very useful for everything that uses some of linear algebra.
2	Keep up with the pace of this class and you will be fine! Hard work but definitely doable.
2	Its hard but its fair for the most part. The exams are a bit tricky.
2	Very difficult class. Be ready for the challenge
2	its hard but rewarding
2	This class is HARD. The midterms are not like the homework, class problems, or practice midterms. This class prides itself off pitting students against each other and encouraging them to fail. This class severely harmed my mental health. The worst part is that this class is a pre-req or requirement for like every single major, you would think they would be super accommodating and helpful, however they are not. None of my accommodations were met, and this class just does not care about the students in it. There are literally students that fail midterms but understand the material. This class does not accurately determine a student's knowledge. If by some miracle you do not have to take this class, then don't. If you are considering CME 100 or Math 51 take CME 100.
