0	This course is very well taught and if you have any interest at all in trying CS then absolutely take it. Pay attention in lectures and assignments shouldn't be too bad and the exams are very fair.
0	Take the course! I learned so much and had a lot of fun. I had no prior coding experience, so I was nervous, but it's super accessible and well organized
0	Go to class and section.
0	If you have interests in coding, take this course. If you do not like coding but are required to take this course for your major, you will probably not enjoy it because of the nature of the subject, but the instruction is great. The environment of this course if very understanding and I have never been made to feel stupid for not understanding something.
0	This class is made really well to make the students get interested in CS.
0	There's a big learning curve.
0	This course is super well taught and fun. It's a wonderful introduction to coding. I definitely recommend taking it if you even have a sliver of interest in coding.
0	TAKE THIS CLASS!! Nick is an amazing instructor and keeps class so interesting. It's genuinely catered to beginners and those who have no experience with coding, and by the end you get a really strong foundation in Python as well as a deeper understanding of how computers work which is useful for practically any field.
0	Regardless of if you are planning to be a computer science major or not, I would absolutely recommend this course! The teaching staff is extremely open and helpful, the concepts are manageable to grasp, and the assignments are reasonable.
0	I won't lie and say that this class is easy. But if put in the time and dedication, the material is given to you in a way that allows you to succeed. Read the homeworks carefully. If you've never taken a single coding class before like me, it can be intimidating in the beginning... but hang in there. You'll be doing some really cool stuff by the end.
0	It is somewhat beginner friendly, but still a great class to take. Also time consuming.
0	Definitely worth taking to pick up some basic skills--it's very approachable even if you have no coding experience, the homework assignments match the content covered in class pretty well, and Nick is an engaging instructor who goes at a pace that's very easy to follow. Worth it for anyone in any major and probably the only enjoyable large introductory course I have taken at Stanford so far.
0	Great course. No matter what major you are in, coding and python in general trains your logic and helps you think better.
0	TAKE THIS CLASS! 106A is an incredible course for anyone, regardless of your major or background (I had zero previous experience coding before 106A). The instruction is fantastic, the programming is fun, and Python is an incredibly useful skill to have. Nick is extremely knowledgeable and makes lectures very fun, and the weekly homework assignments are fairly easy because the concepts are so well-taught. Definitely my favorite class at Stanford so far!
0	Definitely take it! Took it with some prior coding experience (did not think I would have felt confident enough to go straight to 106B) and there's still a lot you can learn. I got through just fine by looking at the lecture notes. P-sets are interesting to work on (watch out for Babynames, that's longer) but occasionally instructions may be slightly unclear E just ask for clarification. Overall would 100% take again.
0	It helped me learn to code, and I recommend it I think if this is down your lane of interest and bandwidth hopefully
0	You go to a top computer science university, might as well take a CS class. You learn the basics of coding, but the psets will take a while.
0	The course itself is straightforward if you are aware that it is a time commitment that may sometimes exceed its 5-unit appearance. Otherwise, you might find yourself struggling to get assignments in on time.
0	Would highly recommend taking it!
0	Such a fantastic class, no matter what you want to study, you should probably take this course. Pedagogically impeccable and so much fun.
0	"@ My fuzzies, you can take this class. It definitely exercises a different part of your brain, specifically your logic and problem solving skills. It really made sense that python is called a ""language"", as you are learning grammar (syntax), and words specific to Python code. This aspect is honestly pretty fuzzy by nature. The teaching within this class feels very polished, like you are the hundredth class to be taught by that professor, and whatever problem you run into, they've seen it before. I spent a looooot of time in LaIR and Black LaIR. There are some days where you will get the assignments right away, and other days where you will curse the day that you signed up to take 106a. There were many nights I had to go to Lair instead of hang out with friends, or miss Friday night events because I was sweating over CS. Try your best to keep up with the material as much as possible/do the hw yourself as much as possible. I admittedly relied on the resources a little too much, and had a lot of catchup to do at the end, which was hard to manage. Overall a good class, but would definitely balance it out with non-PSET classes. You can do it!"
0	Take it!! I was super nervous for this course because I don't have coding experience, but Nick lectures so well and explains everything in great detail. The class is organized and taught so well, they want you to succeed.
0	Good intro class to take, moves fast so stay on top of your work
1	Definitely be prepared to put in the work
1	Assignments can take a long time so plan accordingly
1	"The curriculum of CS 106B, along with the expectations, demands, difficulty, etc, famously vary between instructors. It's well known that Keith's version of CS 106B is considered to be the most difficult, as he spends more time on recursion and asks more out of students, and the exams seem to be harder than in other quarters. But if you intend to continue taking CS classes past CS 106B, consider this before you plan your schedule away from Keith - completing Keith's version will make you far better prepared for later courses such as CS 107 and CS 161, and taking an ""easier"" variant will put you at a distinct disadvantage later on in classes, interviews, and real-world programming. It's a good idea to invest in understanding CS fundamentals as much as possible."
1	Keith is an excellent lecturer and instructor, but his assignments and overall pace are overwhelming. This was reiterated by many of my peers, especially around the midterm. Luckily, the teaching team seemed to take the feedback from the midterm and made improvements on the final. I would say to take this course with Keith if you are comfortable with a fast-paced lecture style and aren't afraid of challenging and lengthy psets.
1	Do not take it with Keith, the assignments are way too hard for no reason. The other professors are much better
1	The psets are unreasonably long. It feels like they think this class is the only class you are taking. The midterm and final need some restructuring. There was a lot of drama this quarter surrounding them.
1	Sections and office hours as well as LAIR are highly highly recommended to do well in this class.
1	Keith is a good professor and you will learn a TON! The HW is really tricky and difficult, but if you have the time, you will truly learn the concepts properly with Keith. However, be careful. 100% have a partner or you will regret it. Also, I would recommend it taking it with Keith ONLY if that's your only difficult class. Do NOT take it with Math51, Physics or any other difficult classes, it will be bad for both your mental health and grades.
1	Solid course, Keith is great!
1	It's REALLY a time commitment, if you're serious about doing it yourself and really learning. However, looking back, I feel like this was a good experience and I really learned a lot.
1	This course was extremely difficult, but if you have the time in your schedule to commit yourself to this class, it is useful. This class moves quickly and the assignments take up a lot of time. Keith is a great instructor, however I would recommend taking this class with a different instructor if you are not able to commit extra time to this class because Keith's version is a little different. Also, he gives an estimate of how much time it will take you to complete a test, and that estimate is very low. This class helped me decide that I no longer want to take CS classes.
1	ton of work but you learn a lot
1	Good and important primer to CS fundamentals, take note that the workload can be pretty intense
1	Stay on top of your lectures. Even though they are offered online don't delay watching new lectures.
1	Make sure to take good notes in lecture and think through the coding strategies that are presented and also when you take on the assignments themselves. Make sure to map out on paper what your logical approach to a particular assignment is, as I think it's a great way of reinforcing what you learned.
1	I really liked CS 106B. Yes, it is a time consuming class but Keith was an amazing lecturer and I truly feel like a better coder after this quarter.
1	Be ready to put in a lot of work for this class, but hopefully you find it worth it! Definitely trained my thinking and coding skills a whole lot!
1	Take this course, learned a lot.
1	Be excited to learn new things, especially recursion.
1	Take it! I love Keith's lecture. So energetic and so interesting! It is not as difficult as some other people asy. Start the homework early (by early I mean the first day you can get help in Lair) and seek help when you need it in Lair. You will honestly be fine. I only began CS after coming to Stanford and personally loved this course.
2	andrew is amaaazing , definitely take it if you feel unconfident in the class material!
2	Andrew is perfect and so helpful
2	Take it. It is almost a necessary companion to CS107. The extra office hours alone make it worth it
2	Pat, Julie and the course staff are amazing. Intense class but incredibly rewarding.
2	If you want to feel confident about how a computer works and how to use all manner of sensors and hardware, this is the course for you. Make sure you plan on allotting quite a bit of time for this course! It will be the main event of your term.
2	I would not recommend taking this course in a heavy quarter. Be prepared to spend time exceeding 5 units of work for this class.
2	Amazing class, it's a lot of work but you end building a computer from the ground up so it's SUPER COOL
2	Start the projects really really early, they can take much longer than you might think, and sometimes one bug can take 90% of your time.
2	If you aren't ready for enormous amount of stress, don't take it!
2	I would definitely recommend it because it is fun and helps develop fundamentals
2	You may struggle but it will be worth it!! I genuinely enjoyed the class and feel much stronger as a programmer. The class is manageable if you start the assignments early and spread out the work as much as possible. The notorious heap allocator assignment deserves its reputation, so have fun!
2	The class is challenging but rewarding! Secure vault and heap allocator take a lot of time to complete, but they are very doable so don't be scared.
2	a lot of work
2	Tough but rewarding. Take CS 107A with it if possible
2	This course is hard and a lot of work, but you also learn a ton. Instructors are very nice and understanding. You become a better programmer after finishing this course.
2	This class is known for being challenging. Go into this class understanding and embracing that fact and the course experience is significantly better. The teachers and course staff are beyond helpful with questions and will make sure that every student understands the material before moving on.
2	Takes a lot of time. Very valuable course.
2	Extremely interesting course that discusses the mechanisms and principles behind computer languages with a little bit heavy workload. Definitely take it if you want to further your programming skills.
2	Well, I guess if you are taking it, then you are probably CS, so there isn't a choice here. Chris Gregg is pretty dope so consider taking it with him.
2	I didn't find this class super hard, but it takes about 20-25 hours per week, less at the beginning of the quarter and more at the end. I spent more time on this class than math 51 and Econ 1 combined. It should be weighted 10 units. They grade the assignments considerably harder than 106B.
2	Hard but rewarding
2	Chris is a fantastic professor, and my favorite professor at Stanford so far! His charisma really rubs off on you. The course reader for the course is super helpful, and the PSets are actually applicable and fun! Definitely take this course if you are interested in establishing a foundation of the math behind machine learning or artificial intelligence.
2	You will learn a lot. Hopefully, the use of the PSet App is permanent. It allowed us to check whether our answers were Problem Set answers were correct.
2	Take it, especially if it's with Chris Piech! You will learn a lot not just about probability but being creative in applying it.
2	Chris Piech is a really good lecturer - course materials (i.e. psets and course readers) were also excellent.
2	If you are interested in learning more about how real world phenomena are modeled and interpreted using probability and computing, take this course. Chris is a fantastic instructor!
2	BEST CLASS AT STANFORD! You learn so much, Chris Piech is amazing, and the material is just fascinating. Highly, highly, recommend.
2	Definitely take it along with 109!
1	Cynthia knows her shit and is friendly but is not an engaging lecturer. Given that the material is really dry already, I didn't go to lecture much. Content also too theoretical / abstract for my liking, even if sometimes fairly interesting.
1	TAs are sometimes not good with grading. Proofs are graded punitively and are unrealistic compared to standards of proof-based math classes. Otherwise it's good.
1	You need to understand the material to pass the class, regardless of how much time you put into it. It's definitely a more conceptual class than a lot of CS classes out there and is definitely challenging for many, so don't feel bad if you struggle in this class.
1	It is a great class and stick with the work and go to all of the lectures.
1	This was probably my favorite course in the CS core. Take it with Cynthia! The PSETS and exams were very reasonable, and the teaching team was very accommodating.
1	Do it! Interesting way to build a mathematical foundation for CS
1	A little tedious if you have proof-writing experience, but ultimately a chill introduction to computability theory.
1	highly recommend taking to improve your proofwriting and learn about theory in computer science. i took this course at the same time as cs107 and while i wouldn't recommend doing so, it is doable.
1	CS103 is challenging, but conquerable, even if you have no background in writing proofs/this type of material. I wouldn't have taken it if not for SymSys, and it might not have been my favorite class in all (it's particularly tedious/not necessarily applicable at times), but there are undoubtedly moments where you come to a rewarding revelation and you forget how much energy it took to generate the result or write up prior dense proofs. I'd recommend trying to become used to not getting everything as soon as possible; it's tempting to want to hammer away until you have a perfect PSet, but it's impractical and hardly feasible, especially if working solo.
1	Take the course even if you aren't a CS major. The content is VERY different from anything you've seen before, and if you enjoy problem solving and want to learn something new, you will love this course.
1	Good class. Professor lee is great and understanding so would def recommend taking it with them if possible.
1	The course genuinely had some interesting content. But 2:30 PM Friday assignment deadlines for PSETs.I wish I just took 154 instead. I don't have much math background, but the course was still way too hand-holdy for my tastes.Boring for the first 8 weeks. Quite difficult towards the end.To be fair, it is quite organized.However, the instructors are quite kind and generally available over Ed.
2	The class is designed for students to be able to succeed. It requires regular effort, but no question should be impossible.
2	You learn a lot about computer algorithms and this course teaches you really important concepts!
2	it do be hard
2	The teaching staff was more concerned with ensuring academic honesty than over well being and learning for the class. Some CA's would not help at all at office hours while others would. Overall, it sucks that CS students need to take this for a requirement because the class is so poorly taught.
2	Start the homeworks early, go to office hours
2	The material was very interesting and struggling through the PSETs is rewarding and where most of the learning will come from! Unfortunately, the instruction in lectures was very hard to consume and not immediately relevant / applicable to the psets always. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on problems because they are often vague and worded poorly.
2	It can be challenging at times - make sure to stay persistent and don't give up! At the end, you will learn a ton.
2	This class is difficult. Take that into account when figuring out your courseload.
2	This class is really hard. Expect to spend lots of time on the psets.
2	Pretty difficult class with long psets at the beginning and lots of content covered but it is all necessary
2	DonEt take it with Nima and Moses. Bad course, was not taught well
2	Terrible course with a terrible teaching team.
2	This course is amazing! It is a must-take for anyone pursuing any technical / engineering degree at Stanford. Every field uses algorithms in some form or fashion. This course gives you an immense understanding and appreciation for algorithms and data structures that is super helpful for anyone in an engineering or technical field.
2	This class is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken at Stanford. I required office hours to do every problem set but the TAs are great and so supportive. Be prepared for VERY hard exams. The lecture's aren't super well taught but if you are confused about concepts there are more than enough office hours and sections to get your questions answered.
2	asf
2	Moses and Nima are good lecturers with great slides and explained hard or nuanced concepts well within a short lecture time. There were some instances in which the proof or explanation of something was being left for students to figure out, which was a huge contrast from 107 or 103 where we were walked through each step clearly. Response times and quality on Ed were unpredictable. Some TAs wrote impressively good responses. At other times, replies were slow compared to the other CS core classes, and most of the times, responses would come from other students. The professors and TAs would purposely refrain from answering some questions in hopes that other students would chip in. There were cases in which questions about the HW were left unanswered days after the HW was due. Concept checks were a good metric but provide solutions for them in future quarters. Even though section is optional and one section was recorded, I wish more section times were offered. This was the only CS class where the TA consistently got through the entire section handout, so kudos for that!I LIVED in office hours for the latter half of this course. TAs were very helpful and did comprehensive walkthroughs for some problems. There were often big differences between the TA's levels of helpfulness or even barebones interpretation of HW questions though - example, on whether a rigorous proof is required, or which approach to take to solve a question, which made things frustrating and confusing.Problem sets were helpful for learning the material. Some were too long, one had unreasonably complicated questions, and a fair amount of ambiguities. At one point, I felt that HW scores were not a representation of one's ability but rather how much time they have to go to office hours and squeeze out answers or clarifications from the TAs. HWs need to be designed better to remove such problems. HW grades could've been released in a more timely manner.The midterm was like a hackathon during the week. It was long with very tough questions, but I don't know how it could've been improved. So many students cheated, and I don't even know if all of them were identified, which is annoying. The midterm and final were both on the difficult end. Everything is left up to the curve and how your peers do, which isn't ideal since some students already know this material from tech interviews or competitive math.Everyone talks about 107 and 103, but 161's difficulty can catch you off guard. Part of this is because algorithms is inherently a hard class.All in all, I learned a lot from this course about a number of important topics in algorithms. Take 103 before. This course is already hard enough if you know proofs, so make sure you are comfortable with induction, contradiction, and other concepts from 103. 109 is helpful for the randomized algo section but not much. Study for this course in advance. This course is so fast paced, and 4 weeks is not enough time to go from hearing the terms dynamic programming and greedy for the first time to confidently taking a final exam about them. Doing well on these topics so quickly takes an insane amount of practice or mathematical background.
2	Definitely the hardest CS class I've taken at Stanford so far. Start early on problem sets and go to office hours for help. Ed posts are also essential.
2	algorithms :)
2	Lots of proofs, expect to spend a lot of time on problem sets
2	You learn a lot about computer algorithms and this course teaches you really important concepts!
2	Good class, just everything that is taught can be found online and explained a little bit shorter. The expectations aren't super clear, (ie. for homeworks, whether we needed to write formal proofs, pseudocode or just an explanation, etc). and grading didn't always align with expectations. Also for the midterm, when they said that it would take 3 hours in the 48 hour window and most students took over 15 hours to complete it. Make sure you go to office hours to understand what the teaching team is asking.
2	Fun class!
2	This is a well-organized and informative class. The lectures and sections are very clear.
2	Honestly don't take this unless it's taught better
2	This class was not super organized, and it was very frustrating. Multiple times I would go to Office Hours on the day a PSet was due, and the TA would not show up. Mind you, it was still listed on the Calendar, and there was no email announcement or Ed post about it being cancelled or rescheduled. Instruction was not great, I had to rely on Office Hours just to be able to begin most of the problems on the PSet. The midterm was supposed to take 3 hours, but we heard that it took TAs 4+ hours to do it, and it ended up taking me the entire 48 hours it was open to do it (close to 24 hours actually spent working on it) because of its difficulty. I understand this class is known for being hard, but the logistical and teaching staff issues made the class much more of a nightmare than it would've been if the content was the worst thing about the class. I'm sure no one is taking this for fun, but just be warned. Jose was an angel in OHEcould not hav
2	Things get more interesting the second half of class. Long weekly psets so plan accordingly.
2	"Taking this class in Winter 2022, the lectures seemed to be incomplete. Keep in mind that all the lecture slides, class notes, and example code were not written by the current instructors, but by Mary Wootters, one of the best lecturers and instructors at Stanford. However, the winter instructors Nima & Moses always seem to be uncomfortable teaching from someone else's words. The lectures were always missing the spirit and energy that world-class instructors deliver when they craft every aspect of their own lectures. Expect to spend a lot of time at office hours and looking through the textbook, as much of the knowledge required for the homework assignments is only briefly mentioned in the lectures. Proofs are ""hand-waved"" away in the lectures but expected with rigor by students. While this quarter's instructors are extremely accomplished and skilled computer scientists, I would wait until Mary teaches 161 again before considering this class."
2	Don't take it with Moses and Nima. The material is interesting, but the course they teach is extremely disorganized. The lectures were needlessly confusing, I ended up relying on my section TA to explain the concepts to me and went to office hours for every single pset. They administered a 48 hour take home midterm and had a ton of honor code violations. This class could have been great but there was a lot of needless confusion and stress that it was the worst CS class I've taken at Stanford.
2	This is not a very fun course and a substantial amount of work. It was pretty organized and well-taught. You have to take it to go through the CS core so keep your head up and you'll get through it. Make sure you find a strong support system in the class (friends and TAs) to get through it.
2	This is a tough class, with very conceptualy challenging content and really difficult assignments. There seemed to often be a big jump between assignments and lectures, so go to OHs as early and often as you need to get a handle on why the problems are the way they are. Without the lovely TAs/CAs that were helping us throughout the quarter, I wouldn't have made it past any of the assignments. The midterms and finals for this year were extremely difficult, specifically the final. So if you have to take this class for your major/minor, expect to put in a LOT of effort if you want a decent grade.
2	Instructors don't teach well. Tests are harder than they need to be.
2	If you're gonna take this class, be ready for extremely long and hard PSETs and insanely difficult exams. Try not to take it with Nima & Moses if you can.
2	This is a great course for you if you want to learn basic knowledge about algorithm, and maybe decide to dig into one kind of algorithm later on, but if you want to learn it very well, you'll definitely put a lot of effort into this course.
2	Avery is an amazing teacher! This was a super helpful class. I highly recommend for anyone that struggles to grasp cs concepts on the first go. Avery walks you through any conceptual issues you have and explains material in a super helpful manner!!
2	161 is a difficult class, but 161A is such a big help. If you have any doubt in your algorithm or proof skills, I would recommend this class. Definitely helped having this section during the quarter.
2	Don't skip lecture.
2	This class covers A LOT OF CONTENT in very little time. You will barely grasp one concept before moving on to a new one. The tests are not reflective of material learned in class, and you must be prepared to expand your knowledge to unimaginable levels. If you are planning on taking this class, I would highly recommend having no other difficult classes at the same time.
2	This class is hard, but extremely rewarding if you put in time. Take it with Gene if you can. I literally learned so much in this class in such a short period of time. Math 51 opens yourself to so many opportunities/applications in so many fields.
2	The class is taught well, the textbook is helpful. However, it moves very very fast. Gene Kim is excellent
2	Definintely look into other sources for learning the course material along with the lectures.
2	To be completely honest, this class is hard. I have had no experience with linear algebra or multivariable calculus before. When taking the class, I feel like everyone else around me already learned everything or learned at least 1 topic that was discussed. The material was entirely new to me, so I struggled so much. I recommend going to discussion or at least doing the worksheets. Also, make sure you understand the psets. Expect to struggle a bit more on the midterm than the psets. I also recommend taking it in the spring or with a schedule where you can actually focus on this class if you are new to the topics.
2	Overall definitely a must-take for stronger clarity of concepts in mathematics and its applications in other correlated fields, particularly CS.
2	This class is very hard. There is a ton of content squeezed into 10 weeks and definitely not enough time to cover all of it. Because it moves so quickly, it is hard to really understand and digest topics because very little time is spent on each one. As a result, the class was quite overwhelming as I always felt like I was playing catch-up. I understand that this course is a requirement for many majors - and some the content actually is quite interesting - but overall it was a very stressful experience due to the structure and pace of the course. The problem sets and exams were very difficult as well. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are super passionate about math and/or need it for a major requirement. That being said, Jinyoung Park is a great instructor. She is funny, kind, explains concepts well, and is very receptive to questions. She definitely made the class better.
2	Watch 3Blue1Brown!!!!
2	A good class with interesting applications. It is very fast paced, so don't get too behind and start the P-sets relatively early.
2	It goes really fast so make sure you understand concepts when they're first learned so studying for exams is actually studying rather than trying to learn five entire chapter of math in one night
2	Stay on top of assignments. Read the book if youEre confused and go to office hours
2	Interesting material, but leaves certain gaps in understanding. Try to read the proofs given in the textbook for the results that are assumed to be true in the course.
2	The quality of instruction for Math 51 is highly dependent on the instructor. I had Mark Lucianovic,who unfortunately wasn't the best lecturer and left me behind other Math 51 students. Please use 3Blue1Brown to visualize the linear algebra portion of the class! Math 21 was not necessary at all for this course from what I've seen. Midterms and Finals this quarter were pretty similar to the practices (some a bit harder and some easier). Keep up with section, do lots of practice problems, go to office hours, and you'll be set. Not the nightmare most people say it is & doable without previous Linear/MVC experience.
2	Go to lecture, but also the textbook can often give you all the answers you're looking for if you're not too comfortable with any topic.
2	Learning the course material ahead of time is very beneficial because although the material is understandable, the course moves very quickly, so knowing things ahead definitely helps with comprehension.
2	This class is a fun class
2	This is a very fast-paced course, but it is extremely organised and well-taught. Pre-readings are a questionnaire are required before each class and I found they really helped to prime my mind before class, given the weight of new material. Exams were somewhat challenging but I felt well-prepared given the instruction. Section is also a helpful resource, and there are video solutions provided for section which you can go over afterwards. Overall, a very good course.
2	Too much info jammed into one quarter!
2	This is a really laborious and stressful class. The math itself is not impossible, but the amount of material covered is simply too much to be processed over the amount of time it is taught, and the tests are usually more difficult than majority of the practice you receive. Be ready to work really hard.
2	Although this course is famously challenging at Stanford, I would still encourage future students to take it. After all, we are not here for easy things. As a potential engineering major, I was considering between the CME series and the Math series. After talking to my UAD and the professors of my potential major, I figured out that taking either of them would be both helpful for an engineering major. If you have similar concerns, don't worry too much about which series is the best/the right one. Start the psets early and discuss with peers. Go to lectures and discussions. Preview and review right before and after the lectures. Do the examples in the textbook. Redo the problems on the lecture worksheets. This course is fun; the problem is just it has a lot to teach, and sometimes I had to sacrifice some details to keep up with the lectures.
2	This class is tough and a lot of work, but there are a fair amount of resources to help you through it.
2	This is a great class. Truly satisfying at the end.
2	This course is hard! It is definitely the hardest class I've taken at Stanford, especially as someone with no experience in multivariable calculus or linear algebra. The course moves extremely fast. By the time you start to understand a concept, the class has already moved on to the next two chapters. I would recommend that you do not take this class at the same time as any other difficult courses, as Math 51 requires a large time commitment and my hinder your abilities to study for other courses.
2	I would take a light quarter when taking this course because it requires a ton of self initiative and self discipline to do well in this course.
2	Do not take 51 unless you really need to. There is so much material packed into the 10 weeks, and it is a nonstop sprint to the end. The textbook is very confusing and the way in which the class in laid out is hard to navigate. Nonetheless, Gene Kim is an amazing lecturer, and he really cares about his students, but his humor is a little bit at the expense of some students.
2	This class was very difficult but I learned a lot about matrices!
2	While the class is challenging especially in the last third of the course or so, the workload is very manageable and gaining a deep understanding of concepts is very doable if you go to office hours and/or SUMO. To save yourself stress, definitely start the homework early and split up the work over several days. Try your best to not miss any lectures (they are not recorded) and although section is not mandatory, make sure to go to all of those as well.
