0	If you want to learn about CS take this course
0	Don't get discouraged if you don't understand right away. When it feels like everyone knows what they're doing, I promise you're not alone and the professors, TAs and section leaders are cognizant of the steep learning curve as well.
0	Great starter for coding - get your feet wet and find out if coding is for you
0	Well structured, they have been perfecting this class for years and it shows
0	this class is designed for beginners and to help beginners succeed. midterm/final are not bad and your grade will probably be fine even if you don't put in that much effort, but that being said, if you really want to get a lot out of the course, make sure to spend a lot of time refining concepts and doing psets.
0	This class is very well structured.
0	I highly recommend taking this class, especially if you have never coded before. You'll gain exposure to an amazing field and possibly discover a passion for it. There are so many resources that will help you along the way too.
0	Course is very beginner friendly! Beneficial to have a group of friends to take class with, if you are a slow learner like me. Hearing other people think about CS topics in different ways will engage your learning. Weeks 3-5 are definitely the roughest, plan your time accordingly. Take advantage of LaIR, not just debugging, but conceptual help too!!
0	This course is an amazing introduction to computer science, friendly to students of all backgrounds. I would 100% recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in cs. Plus Nick Parlante is an amazing lecturer with funny jokes.
0	Absolutely a must-take course for every student at Stanford.
0	I had no CS experience, and 106a was very manageable and quite fun. The class is so organized with tons of extra resources set up to support you. The lectures are very comprehensive with tons of examples. You get a lot of practice material for the midterm and final, both of which are very similar to the practice exam that they give you.
0	If you have interests in coding, take this course. If you do not like coding but are required to take this course for your major, you will probably not enjoy it because of the nature of the subject, but the instruction is great. The environment of this course if very understanding and I have never been made to feel stupid for not understanding something.
0	Don't fret!  This isn't bad.  But, be prepared to work moderately hard.  Nothing was too difficult though.
0	If you are interested in CS, take it. If not, I don't think it's worth the stress.
0	do it
0	Take it with Nick Parlante. He is literally king energy. Super thorough in his instruction and really funny. Assignment's instructions are hard to understand and unclear at times, but if you know what it is asking, it will literally take you 45 minutes to do the whole thing.
0	"If you aren't interested in CS I probably wouldn't take it. I thought I should take a ""Stanford CS Class"" because of notoriety. In hindsight, I don't care how great the class is, if you don't care for the subject you won't want to be spending 15 hours a week on it."
0	Excellent course, very beginner friendly and accessible to people who haven't done coding before. Great teaching team. Mind as well take it, you're at Stanford.
0	You can take this class even if you've never taken CS or aren't a CS major. Sometimes the HW questions can be hard to understand what they're asking, but Lair and SL's are extremely helpful. It's accurate to being 5 units.
0	Nick Parlante is a great teacher who really helps you understand the material. The class feels like a very good pace E slow enough that you're absorbing the info but also fast enough to go over a lot. The homework assignments are a good degree of challenging but definelty not overwhelming. Loved the class overall.
0	There's a big learning curve.
0	Don't let yourself get behind because the class is very fast paced!
0	Definitely take out! This class is really well-taught and super interesting. Not having a coding background did not stop me from learning about the concepts in this course.
0	This is, as they say, friendly for students that have not taken any computer science class in the past. So I would recommend this class to any student.
0	A great class, definitely recommend it.
0	I would HIGHLY recommend that a student take this course. It has been my favorite class at Stanford thus far. If you do not know programming, that is okay. This class will help you. While this class can be challenging at times, there are so many wonderful resources at your disposal including TA's, office hours, LAIR, and other advanced CS students in the dorm.
0	TAKE THIS CLASS!! Nick is an amazing instructor and keeps class so interesting. It's genuinely catered to beginners and those who have no experience with coding, and by the end you get a really strong foundation in Python as well as a deeper understanding of how computers work which is useful for practically any field.
0	You don't have to know anything about coding to take this course.
0	Very good class for intro to CS. Not much else to say here. Honestly, essential to the Stanford Experience regardless of interest!
0	This class is fun but can be challenging at times; it is helpful to make use of office hours or other resources.
0	"It's a really fun introduction to programming, but I think sometimes it can be hard to fathom how the programs you are writing can be scaled to the ""real world"" of programming."
0	Take this course if you are a STEM major as the world is evolving to become more tech savvy it is nice to have a basic understanding of coding even if you don't continue past 106A. Plus, Nick is AMAZING professor, he is also very adorable with his little commentary. #106Awoohoo
0	I am a humanities person but still find the class to be enjoyable. This is not my first CS class, but some of the concepts still moderately challenged me. Everyone is given enough resources to succeed in the class, which I greatly appreciate.
0	I highly recommend 106A, it is structured in a way that is easy to understand both for non-CS majors and people who have never programmed before. The professors are very dynamic and great at their job. I think you will enjoy it a lot!
0	Great course. No matter what major you are in, coding and python in general trains your logic and helps you think better.
0	Take this class! I came in with zero coding experience, but I'm quite confident in my coding ability now and am honestly inspired to take more CS classes in the future. Dr. Parlante is a great instructor.
0	Stay on top of lectures
0	Do take it! Prof. Parlante is very good at teaching the class and the slew of TAs are there to help you if you need it. A very good intro to Python and everything was explained from the base level upwards (no prior knowledge required at all, and this is coming from a complete CS noob like me).
0	Study hard for the final and do good
0	It is very fast in the beginning and watching lectures is important.
0	Must-take for any student.  Coding python is a great skill to know and CS106A is a great, not super hard class.
0	Great class if you have no experience coding.
0	Easy intro-level course, attendance not required to get a good grade and a solid foundation in Python
0	Everyone should take it.
0	Definitely take this class if you have any interest in CS or exploring quantitative skills. The class is very well taught and the assignments are engaging and interesting. I also think it offers an intro to both coding and data science which is helpful for people who are interested in STEM and also applying quantitative skills to the humanities.
0	Great intro level coding class. Very manageable and tests are always fair/you know what to expect. Nick Parlante is a great lecturer -- very engaging and easy to understand.
0	Its Stanford, you should take at least one CS course while you're here. If you've never coded before like me then this is a good course to take
0	ItEs a great introduction to CS and coding.
0	Nick Parlante is an engaging instructor; he is excellent at breaking down concepts into bite-sized pieces and explaining them well. A fun CS course for a person with negligible CS experience.
0	A great way to get into programming, improve programming if you're a novice, and learn intro Python.
0	If you are taking CS106A, make sure to attend section and work through each problem using visualizations. It helps to understand how the code works.
0	Take it! ItEs so much fun and gives you a great framework to base and structure thought and future projects.
0	As a student who had no background in coding, I really enjoyed taking this class and found it to be very rewarding!
0	The course itself is straightforward if you are aware that it is a time commitment that may sometimes exceed its 5-unit appearance. Otherwise, you might find yourself struggling to get assignments in on time.
0	Make sure you start your assignment early!
0	really great course even for students who have had some previous experience in programming
0	This course is great for an introduction to coding (Python), and the assignments focus on relevant topics and produce cool results. If you take this class and have never coded before I highly recommend taking a light course load. Coding is especially time consuming. Professor Parlante and TA Woodrow are great! They make lectures engaging and the lectures/notes are comprehensive. Professor Parlante and TA Woodrow are also extremely encouraging.
1	Assignments can take a long time so plan accordingly
1	This is a brilliant class and while the assignments are certainly tough, Keith is a wonderful teacher. The only thing I would recommend is when teaching recursive backtracking, teach it using choose / un-choose first rather than using const references. I watched a lecture on YouTube by Julie Zelenski on recursive backtracking and it helped me so much in understand the thought process behind why we use it. It gave an example of the queens on a chess board.
1	It is a step up from CS106A, but there is a lot to take from this course. I would highly recommend having a partner and to use the weekends to start the assignments.
1	Be wary of taking it with Keith if you're not ready to put in a ton of work and set aside the time to do it right. But if you really want to improve your coding skills, this is a great course!
1	Keith is a tough professor, but you will be challenged and as a result learn a lot. Keep up with the lectures and make sure to do practice problems.
1	If you don't feel too confident from 106A, don't take it. This class was really difficult for me and definitely wore me down and ruined my quarter. There's a huge amount of support and resources but it always felt like if you don't know how to apply the code right away, you're just left behind. Also, they changed the final format, to a 6 hour take-home, instead of a 72 hour take-home, after the C/NC | withdraw deadline, which isn't great considering I would've made it C/NC if they announced it prior. Also, there's a huge dissonance between the great lectures, and the difficulty of the hw. I, among others who only had coding experience from 106A, definitely felt left behind by the teaching staff and experienced coders. Also, them moving LAIR to in-person, to me, felt pre-meditated so less students utilize LAIR.
1	Do not take this class with Keith. I had an awful time in this class. Easily one of my worst quarters. While in this class myself and my classmates had to visit CAPS regularly to cope with the stress and pressure of the course. Save yourself the suffering and take it with someone else
1	It's a tough class but it will make you a lot better at CS!
1	Start homework early, and do lots of recursion problems. Always try to understand what you are coding and why you are coding.
1	"Don't take this class with Keith! You will greatly regret it. While he is upbeat and attempts to be engaging in lectures, the topics and practice problems we cover in lecture are nowhere near the difficulty of the p-sets or exams. Speaking of the assignments with friends who took it with other instructors, their final question on their p-sets were oftentimes our warmup questions. It often feels like Keith and the staff are just throwing you into the water with very little support, with Lair completely filling up before its official start time several times this quarter. If nearly 1/3 of the class is asking for help debugging, it likely means that there's something wrong with course design or the way it is taught. A lot of lecture is spent covering very simple examples or concepts and the homework often involves techniques, containers, or styles that we've never seen in class before and we're just left to ""have fun and figure it out"". Little efforts have been made to improve these aspects despite multiple student complaints. The staff's solution to increasing accessibility to Lair was to make it in person only, making it more difficult for students to get help, and make the final exam a 6 hour timed exam (informed us of this decision after the withdrawal deadline) while maintaining that the exam is only designed to take us three hours (the same was said of the midterm, and everyone I spoke to spent at least 10~15 hours on it). Overall, bad communication, unnecessarily difficult, and no real reason to take it with Keith when you can have an easier time another quarter and not destroy your mental health every week."
1	Watch out. This could tank your quarter or your GPA if you aren't prepared to use all the available resources. LAIR and edStem are your friends. You will need them. This ISN'T like 106a.Also, don't come in expecting a whole lot of real-world examples that *don't* have to do with computational theory... Which is pretty fun, but maybe not quite what I was expecting to learn.Honestly, I would still take it again though.
1	This is a fantastic class- so well organized and taught. It is a lot of work though
1	It is a big time investment but there are resources there to help alleviate some of the weight
1	You just have to be aware that this class isn't to dabble in coding or see if you like it. This is a full-fledged, complex computer science class that you have to spend time understanding and learning to love or at least like.
1	keith is an amazing lecturer, and his psets and exams are hard. highly recommend having programming experience before taking this class.
1	It's definetely a worthy course for all the engineering students. I'm not CS major, but I feel more confident about my engineering skillset after taking this course.
1	It's a difficult course but it's definitely rewarding
1	Definitely take this class!! I took this class with Keith and it really whipped me into shape for coding. I had a lot of sleepless nights because the assignments are super hard but I know that I learned a lot.
1	Keith is a good professor and you will learn a TON! The HW is really tricky and difficult, but if you have the time, you will truly learn the concepts properly with Keith. However, be careful. 100% have a partner or you will regret it. Also, I would recommend it taking it with Keith ONLY if that's your only difficult class. Do NOT take it with Math51, Physics or any other difficult classes, it will be bad for both your mental health and grades.
1	This course is really excellent, and Keith will make sure you have the most holistic understanding of the topics at hand. At the same time,assignment take up a lot of brainpower and can take many hours, so make sure that you have enough time to dedicate to this course weekly.
1	Make sure to make use of the section classes and material, they are so helpful. Go to lair early and start your assignments early as well!
1	This course is amazing in that you learn so much about application of code, however with Keith, the class simply felt a bit too much. While I would understand the lectures in entirety, the assignments and midterm made me feel unconfident most times about my abilities, and really pushed me both mentally and physically to accomplish the algorithms that we had to solve. While the ideas themselves are not that difficult, it was the tiny bugs and bells-and-whistles that assignments are picky about that made me spend HOURS trying to get help on little errors and simple syntax things that I simply never knew.
1	One of my favorite courses at Stanford, would definitely recommend
1	I personally thought that this class was really well taught and that Keith is a great lecturer. I felt that I learned a lot although sometimes the class takes up a bit of time.
1	A big step up from 106A, but if you're prepared for this you'll enjoy the class and get a lot out of it - you cover so much material in 10 weeks, but make sure you don't get disheartened by the difficulty of assignments on recursion and exams compared to 106A
1	I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that wants to strengthen their aptitude in CS - especially because topics concerning recursion, arrays, and hashing are critical concepts that are imperative to any person interested in CS.
1	Be sure to communicate any struggles early and utilize the help offered now. The course is good for learning how to solve complex problems. Start on the assignments early and take your time working on them consistently.
1	CS 106B in the winter is definitely more challenging than it is in the fall or spring, but it is entirely worth it. I do not believe that I would be able to understand the concepts this class teaches as well if I had taken it in a different quarter. The lecturer and TA's are amazing, and are there to help and listen to you. Definitely would recommend 10/10.
1	Be prepared for a challenge. The class can be fun but remember to budget time for it in your schedule.
1	This is a very well-taught class. It can be challenging at times, but again, it is very well-taught. Lectures are recorded and are great resources to use for revision or additional help when working on assignments. There is always a clear link between problems in class and on assignments and exams. Section is super-helpful if you get a great SL. Overall, would definitely reccommend.
1	Wonderful class that will challenge you but leave you a better quarter. Thankfully there are many resources (e.g. lair) to help you if you are struggling.
1	"Just because ""everyone takes it"" doesn't mean it's easy, I made that mistake when planning my quarter and regretted it. Use lair, because if you're like me and learn by doing, then if you never actually do it right, you won't learn it right and so it's helpful to have someone to check with. A serious step up from 106a, especially with Keith, but the highs on the roller coaster probably about balanced the lows. Maybe not quite."
1	Love this class. Cannot recommend enough.
1	This course showed me that CS is not for me. I tried and tried but the content always seemed out of reach. Lecture seemed surface-level compared to the problems we had to solve, and I struggled way more than I was comfortable with.
1	This class will give you a lot of experience in coding practice and teach you a lot about algorithms and different problem solving approaches. The material is generally laid out to be very accessible. Sometimes, the problem sets required a lot more effort than you were expecting, but there are resources available to you if you know where to look.
1	Stay on top of your lectures. Even though they are offered online don't delay watching new lectures.
1	This is a good course. Have fun!
1	Take CS106B if you are interested in pursuing CS later on at Stanford. Otherwise, its a really hard course and not worth the effort if you are not interested in a minor or major. Keith is a great lecturer but his assignments and tests are brutal.
1	Take it!!!
1	Watch lectures of previous quarters before signing up for the class and make the most of practicing on your own time.
1	It is a lot of work and you need to start early on the assignments and use your time. It is also smart to explore some of the previous semesters online and get a head start in C++ and recursion. Also read the book.
1	The head TA does not respond to emails. Use edstem for any urgency in responses. Otherwise a great course that covers a lot of interesting material.
1	Be ready to put in a lot of work for this class, but hopefully you find it worth it! Definitely trained my thinking and coding skills a whole lot!
1	It is a demanding class but very rewarding if you put the time and effort in. Make sure you start assignments early and don't fall behind on the lectures.
1	Great class
1	Make sure to start assignments early! This will be your biggest helper aside from section leaders, office hours, and LaIR.
1	Great class. Not only teaches you how to program, but how to be a more methodical problem solver. Highly recommend to anyone interested.
2	If you want to feel confident about how a computer works and how to use all manner of sensors and hardware, this is the course for you. Make sure you plan on allotting quite a bit of time for this course! It will be the main event of your term.
2	This class is quite hard and time-consuming, but also incredibly rewarding. If you are open to challenging yourself for the sake of your learning and growth, I highly encourage the course. The content is difficult but the TAs and instructions are all incredibly dedicated to making sure all students succeed.
2	I would not recommend taking this course in a heavy quarter. Be prepared to spend time exceeding 5 units of work for this class.
2	TAKE IT! I am not super into EE, but I had so much fun. Pat and Julie are AWESOME!!!! Super grateful I took this class.
2	This class is incredible. Julie and Pat are absolutely incredible professors. I learned more from this class than any other class I've taken at Stanford. As someone who normally struggles a lot more than the average Stanford student in difficult classes, I found that the content was accessible as long as I had the time to work for it, especially given that Pat and Julie care more about learning than about strict deadlines. It does take a LOT of time, though, so be prepared. There were a couple of weeks where it completely took over my life, and it felt like I had time for almost nothing else. In the end, especially after showing off my skills in the final project, I felt very rewarded, but do ensure that you take into account the workload you will be taking on.
2	I can't possibly recommend 107E with Pat and Julie more. They are sublime teachers with a wealth of knowledge and they are both amazing teachers and wonderful people. You will be pushed hard in this class, but it will feel so rewarding and you will learn so much that you would be foolish to pass up the opportunity to learn in this intimate environment. Take this class, take this class, take this class!
2	This course is a great learning experience and I highly recommend it, especially if you don't have any experience with computer hardware or systems. One thing to note is that it can be quite intensive during the middle part of the quarter, so make sure to plan accordingly. The assignments are very interesting and by the end you'll have a complete suite of functionality that you can take pride in having made yourself.
2	Definitely take this class. It's an intense learning opportunity with very invested instructors/staff. You will get out as much as you put in.
2	This class is incredible!! ItEs challenging but so rewarding. ItEs one of the most engaging cs classes- everything assignment you do has a clear purpose and tangible results. It can be but its so fulfilling, and Pat and Julie are phenomenal lecturers. The tas are amazing and so available to help. Take it, you wonEt regret it.
2	Please take the class with a friend. it can be very isolating sometime if you don't know anyone in the course.
2	TAKE IT! I am not super into EE, but I had so much fun. Pat and Julie are AWESOME!!!! Super grateful I took this class.
2	This course is a great learning experience and I highly recommend it, especially if you don't have any experience with computer hardware or systems.

The assignments are very interesting and by the end you'll have a complete suite of functionality that you can take pride in having made yourself.
2	I learned so much from this class and feel much more confident in my ability to write clean, functional and modular code. Lecture is super entertaining. Pat and Julie make lecture just the absolute best!! Aside from learning about memory, peripherals and program execution from the ground up you also get exposed to and have to learn how to use many new tools such as git, vim, GDB and the command line. Its a steep learning curve for sure and the third and fourth assignment are definitely quite challenging and tedious, however, you walk away form this class having learned so much and feeling really proud and satisfied that you actually built a computer form the ground up. If you have time you should definitely take this class!!!
2	Definitely take this class. It's an intense learning opportunity with very invested instructors/staff. You will get out as much as you put in.
2	Enjoyable class, but not as much hardware experience as you might think it isEstill much more fun than 107!
2	Amazing class, it's a lot of work but you end building a computer from the ground up so it's SUPER COOL
2	"This is hands down the most engaging and challenging course I've taken at Stanford so far. Julie, Pat, and the TAs are wonderful, committed, and passionate about what they teach. I never considered myself a ""maker"" or hardware person, but after 107e, I feel like I could truly appreciate the hardware and unseen work that goes into creating the modern computers we get to have access to. It even convinced me to consider a Systems concentration! Be prepared for a significant workload, especially during Week 5-7-ish and Week 9-10. I wouldn't recommend taking much more on top of 107e to get the most out of the course. From what I've heard from 107 students, 107e is slightly harder but definitely manageable if you invest time into really understanding the concepts."
2	TAKE IT. PERIOD. It might be useful to know that the amount of work peaks at assignment 3 (week 4) and 4 (week 5) and goes a bit lighter from there. But those two can be quite a bit of grind. Definitely take with a friend (or you can make friends in the class). I love how close the class gets at the end of the quarter. I really appreciate that such an amazing course is offered at Stanford. SHOUT OUT TO THE CS107E TEAM. THEY ARE AMAZING!
2	A lot of material is covered in the course. Make sure to start assignments early. Chris Gregg is a great lecturer but even with understanding of the general concepts, if you've never coded in C before it may take the first couple of assignments to get used to it.
2	be ready for a big challenge and make sure that you allocate your time well over the course of the quarter to learning the concepts
2	Not as bad as they say. The course staff is super supportive and the assignments become reasonable in terms of workload when you start them early.
2	It's a hard course but worth it
2	Great course to learn whether you like systems or not. Binary Bomb and Heap Allocator take a lot of time - make sure you start on them early!
2	This course is amazing. I am not a systems person, and I loved it. I know a lot of people go into this feeling like it is a prerequisite they have to knock out and that it will be painful no matter what. In my experience, the thing people complain about most is the hours and hours of debugging. My biggest advice on this front is to pay attention in lab when they teach you debugging tools. It seriously pays off, but most people don't pay attention since it isn't required. I promise it will save you hours. Having spoken with people who faced similar bugs as me after the assignments were done, the things that took them hours could have been really easily solved with conditional breakpoints, breakpoints with commands, watchpoints, etc. If you take the time to learn how to implement those things in the class debugging program (gdb) then you will have a much better time in this course!
2	Very time consuming but I think the content is easier than 106B. Office hours fill up fassssst so be sure to use edstem to post questions
2	Last two assignments (SecureVault and Heap Allocator) are more time-consuming than the previous ones, so be aware of that when planning out your workload for the quarter. Get started on the assignments as early as possible. Even just reading the assignment handouts is a good start, since they take a nontrivial amount of time to read through. Challenging course, but definitely manageable, and you learn a lot! Completing assignments is quite rewarding as well. You will be a better coder after 107, compared to after only 106B.
2	Let me preface this by saying: CS 107 is my favorite CS class I've taken at Stanford. CS 107 is NOT the terrifying beast that many students make it out to be; in fact, although the assignments are difficult and taxing, they are also incredibly rewarding, and I feel as though I've come out of this class having a significantly better understanding of coding methodology and computer systems (like, I actually know what pointers are now). I thought that the material was really interesting, and if you start assignments relatively early and spend a bit of time reviewing lecture slides, this class will be way more enjoyable for you.
2	Definitely a lot of work especially towards the end of the quarter with the final two assignments (around 40 hours over ~1-2 weeks each), so make sure you don't overload on credits if you plan on taking this class. Chris is an amazing instructor who teaches with compassion and genuinely cares about the well-being of his students. He definitely makes the class less brutal to take.
2	Very nice course
2	Extremely interesting course that discusses the mechanisms and principles behind computer languages with a little bit heavy workload. Definitely take it if you want to further your programming skills.
2	I think this course teaches the content it aims to teach very well. I'm not sure how applicable it is to the rest of CS but the class taught me a great deal and the assignments and labs are all well designed.
2	This course is definitely one I would recommend for people interested in computer science. It is important to know that it is a huge time commitment and it is a little bit arbitrary how long it will take you to complete each given assignment because the debugging process can take anywhere from a couple hours to a couple days. Overall, it is a super interesting class that you can learn a lot from.
2	its tough but doable if u put in the time, take an easy load
2	highly recommend taking this class with chris gregg -- he explains concepts well and is so friendly and absolutely amazing at answering questions on ed. personally i really liked this course; even though it is a little difficult and the assignments are quite time-consuming, the learning curve is not as high as cs106b. you learn so much and labs (section) in particular are super valuable. the material is very useful and important, so i recommend taking cs107 after 106b!
2	It's good but hard
2	As someone whose main focus is AI/ML, there wasn't a lot of material in this class that got me really excited. It basically felt like a tour of protocols and standards that a bunch of old white dudes thought up in the 1970s (x86-64 architecture, how to represent integers and floating point numbers, the C language and assembly) that govern the way our computers work today. Useful, perhaps, if you really need to dig deep into some kind of systems application but limited utility elsewhere. I would have much preferred to take something like the CME 211/212/213 series, but c'est la vie that's not the degree I signed up for. Give yourself lots of time for the last two assignments (Bank Security/Assembly Code and Heap Allocator).
2	Save a lot of time towards the end of the quarter for the last two assignments, which are much more time commitment than the first few assignments.
2	This class is a lot of work, but is also very rewarding! Your programming skills will improve a lot over the course - but I highly advise against taking the course unless you have to for your major/minor. The assignments are extremely thorough and will test your knowledge of each intricate detail. It's to the point where it can be extremely frustrating where a small detail throws everything off. Additionally, Office Hours can be completely useless at times, with there being extremely few TAs and sometimes dozens of students in the queue. The TAs themselves are super helpful, but getting access to them can be nearly impossible at times, and it can often feel like you're on your own. But overall, the course content is extremely interesting and engaging. But the assignments (looking at you, heap allocator) can be extremely tedious and time consuming. Budget your time accordingly!
2	Not certain how it is with other professors, but Piech's 109 is masterfully crafted. Great Psets in a great new pset app, solid lectures, good sections with helpful problems, and you feel supported throughout. Be prepared to put in a bit more time towards end of quarter w/ machine learning. Highly recommend
2	Its an amazing class and if you can take it with Chris Piech
2	Very well taught. Fun PSETS on awesome PSET app. The exams seemed much harder than the PSETS, which didn't feel awesome.
2	Overall the class is really fun and I would recommend taking it with Chris Piech. He is an excellent instructor and he has a passion for teaching (which helped me understand a lot of the material). The class does ramp up on difficulty, especially for the final 3 weeks but the new PSET app that professor Chris made is extremely helpful (you are able to check your answers!)
2	ItEs a lot of fun!
2	Great course! Great instructor. Very fun
2	Great course. Take it with Chris Piech.
2	This is one of the best classes I've taken, made even better by Professor Chris Piech. The digital course reader is very effective at summarizing content, and the PSET app works amazingly for reinforcing understanding.
2	The problem sets are now on an app and they are so helpful to learn concepts!
2	One of the best course and best teachers!
2	this class is great! its also taught in a pretty interesting way. the class was hard though and I don't think I put enough time into learning the material as I should have, but i really liked the material. chris is such a great instructor!!!
2	Chris Piech is probably the kindest, most enthusiastic lecturer I've had at Stanford, and he makes 109 content very enjoyable. 109's content is very interesting in general.
2	Chris made this class an awesome experience. The workload is pretty light & the content is fun so definitely take it. A solid intro to stats that's useful for ML classes
2	Excellent instructor!! Some topics can be difficult but Chris makes up for it! My favorite instructor so far
2	I procrastinated taking CS 109 because I expected it to be a really terrible class, but I was pleasantly surprised. The content was interesting, the problem sets were useful, and the midterm exam was pretty generous (the final may be a different story, however). I didn't have to watch lectures until the machine learning module, since the course reader, sections, and automatic feedback for psets helped me learn the material.
2	Take it! Piech is an amazing teacher.
2	If you want to start thinking of probability in a practical manner beyond just theory, this is the class to take.
2	Highly recommend. Chris is an excellent instructor.
2	This was the best class I've taken in my three years as a Symbolic Systems major at Stanford!
2	The TA Staff for my year was VERY GOOD. Office Hours were extremely helpful by them (a must in my opinion) and overall, they all were very nice. I love Chris so much, as he is one of my favorite professors so far.
2	Ian is great!!
2	Take this course! Chris is really nice and the Ace TA was awesome!
2	Make sure to stay up to date with the course because that is the only way the instructor can assist you.
1	it's genuinely a very interesting course, and Cynthia is a great instructor for it!
1	This course was more challenging for me than the more coding-rigorous classes like CS107. I think it was challenging because I had never done any formal proof writing in the context of computer abstractions. I learned a lot but I feel like it is a course that shapes the course load one takes for that quarter.
1	I would take into consideration your holistic course load when considering whether or not to enroll in this course. I inadvertently overburdened myself during this quarter, taking 18 credits, and although 18 is a generally feasible number of units to take concurrently, I had underestimated the time that this course takes throughout the week. The homework is best completed if one has a head start on it, to be able to attend Office Hours if any questions arise (another extremely critical point that I cannot stress enough: Go to Office Hours whenever possible!! Attending office hours was the reason I was able to make my way through the course). You can get a lot out of enrolling in CS103ECynthia is such a knowledgeable instructor who teaches extremely well and the course material is fascinating and provides an in-depth foundation into computer programmingEbut make sure that you don't overburden yourself so that you can get the most out of the course!
1	This is such a good class for someone who has never written a proof in their life. I cannot get over how much I think everyone should take this class when Dr. Lee is teaching it. I have learned so much and can genuinely say, for someone who is not really a math person, this has been my favorite math class at Stanford so far. Office hours are really helpful and the TAs are great!
1	If you have a math background, this class will be very easy for you.
1	Proofs straddle the line between prose and programming.  Make sure to become comfortable with that narrow valley.Remember your final is worth a huge amount of your grade.  Don't stress over the problem sets but do stress over the midterms and make sure you nail the final.
1	One of my favorite CS classes. A little abstract and not very applicable, but very fun and interesting. Heavy workload, but normal for CS.
1	Having some familiarity with proofs will make the first 1/3 of the quarter much easier, and makes learning the content of the course more manageable
1	The couse has 10 psets for 10 weeks and can be very intense.
1	This was probably my favorite course in the CS core. Take it with Cynthia! The PSETS and exams were very reasonable, and the teaching team was very accommodating.
1	This course is one of the most well organized courses I've taken at Stanford. The course material requires you to think, but as long as you pay attention in lecture and be precise, you can do very well!  It also requires you to think a bit differently than other CS classes, so it's very interesting material for someone like me who is new to it!
1	Tough class and the content does not feel applicable some of the time.
1	Content was really interesting but Cynthia was not very accommodating for extensions/accomodations, often not responding to email requests or giving extensions after the deadline passed, which defeats the purpose.
1	The grading of this course is very strict, but the course pushes you a lot. Procrastination will be your worst enemy and office hours will be your best friend.
1	Amazing course, definitely worth teaching. Cynthia makes sure this course is extremely well organized, and the content is very applicable in future courses (e.g. CS161).
1	Take it! I really enjoyed the course. Cynthia and the teaching team were very helpful. The lectures were clear.
1	Tough but kinda fun sometimes
1	Good class!
1	Take the course even if you aren't a CS major. The content is VERY different from anything you've seen before, and if you enjoy problem solving and want to learn something new, you will love this course.
1	I actually really enjoyed this course. Definitely make use of office hours as much as possible and you will be fine. It is a very formulaic class in that once you determine the write approach style you are fine.
1	Don't be scared of writing proofs! lots of resources and templates in class that help with that. The latter part of the course does become challenging though
1	If you have a strong background in proof-writing and discrete math take CS 154 instead. If you are new to proof-writing, I think this class is absolutely perfect.
1	Take it if you are new to proof-based math or if you suspect you will need extra help in the course. At the very least, it is great one-on-one time to ask a TA questions!
2	It's taught fine, but the psets are inordinately time-consuming.
2	This class requires a lot of time - don't take it for granted, and stay on top of all of your material! Go to office hours as much as possible, and make sure to review all of the homework problems prior to exams because many of the problems on exams are modifications of the homework problems.Also, this year's class was largely affected by the large number of people who cheated on this exam. Honestly, we still don't know exactly how many people admitted to cheating or how many people were ultimately caught and punished for their actions, which definitely made this course unfair if people were caught.Aside from this, there are tons of resources available for you to practice, so make sure to take the time to do as much of them as possible.
2	It's a lot of work, and the paradigms are among the most beautiful things I've ever learned.
2	"I didn't expect this class to be as bad as it was - I'm a CS major and I feel like I had heard a lot more hype about CS 107/110 compared to 161. TLDR is that the instructors for the winter are super smart and accomplished in the field, but they don't necessarily understand what it's like to be a student learning these algorithms for the first time and can have a hard time explaining them to someone who doesn't have a background in theoretical math. The psets were very proof/math heavy, so ironically the algorithm design portion of the class was comparatively much easier. I think I will use at least the algorithms portion of the class, but the ratio of ""stuff I will use"" vs ""this isn't useful in practice"" wasn't great.Jose was an incredible section leader and did a great job translating the lectures into concepts a normal person could understand - I wish he had been the one teaching the class! He always would take time before/after section to answer student questions to ensure everyone felt supported. Additionally, he went above and beyond in writing up super helpful guides for various concepts in the class and posting them on Ed.I was very disappointed and frustrated in how the teaching team handled the large amount of cheating on our take-home midterm. We didn't get statistics on how many people cheated, but anecdotally I've heard it was like 25%, which is a significant number of people given the class has around 500 people. They provided an alternative grading scheme that basically made it so that the people who cheated could retract their exams without any grade penalty whatsoever, which sends the message that it's OK to cheat so long as you come clean if you get caught. This class is graded on a curve and as someone who didn't cheat, it's frustrating to know that people literally got ahead at the expense of others and the teaching team seemed to send a message that this was acceptable."
2	it do be hard
2	You probably have to take it for your major anyways.  If you don't there's not too much of a point.
2	Great class. Really fun to work on all of the interesting problems on psets. Take it!
2	The material was very interesting and struggling through the PSETs is rewarding and where most of the learning will come from! Unfortunately, the instruction in lectures was very hard to consume and not immediately relevant / applicable to the psets always. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on problems because they are often vague and worded poorly.
2	It's a lot of work and is extremely difficult, but the knowledge you get out of it is extremely rewarding.
2	This class is difficult. Take that into account when figuring out your courseload.
2	This class was super hard for me, perhaps the hardest class in the CS core. That being said, it was also the class where I learned the most about how to be a better programmer and think critically. (Bonus: as someone who has interviewed / done coding challenges and OAs for internships before taking 161, I can definitely say this class makes it 1000% easier - a lot of the algorithms we learned about are very relevant to coding interviews). In addition, the material is genuinely interesting and engaging. It's definitely a challenging course, though. The material is not always easy to understand and internalize, and part of the difficulty is just applying your knowledge to various situations and creatively thinking. I would recommend starting psets as early as possible and going to office hours for sure. Try to stay on top of the material as it does pile up, especially towards the final exam. The later half of the course was harder than the first half, imo.
2	the tests are unbelievably hard compared to the content
2	its a difficult class but you can learn a lot if you put in the time to. i think the profs did care about us, even though the tests were really difficult. the staff was pretty supportive and the TAs were amazing (especially Jerry and Jose)
2	The lecturers don't communicate the content well and focus on esoteric details/proofs- I learned almost everything relevant to hw/exams from office hours and section. Hws are extremely time consuming and graded harshly; much more difficult than lecture material, many problems poorly written. The 48hr midterm was brutal (~20 pages, i barely slept during the exam window, still didn't finish in time) and devastating to student mental health. Did not make me want to do more cs/algorithms, felt a bit gate-keeping of the CS major. Highly encourage finding a TA you like/can understand and stick with them in section/OH.
2	Fast-paced class, but very worth it
2	Don't take this class unless you have to (aka CS majors). Moses and Nima are OK at teaching the material. Homeworks were really hard, and you basically couldn't figure out half the problems without relying on office hours. The midterm was also really hard; it was open for a 48 hour period and meant to take 3 hours, but it took me about 15 hours and there were still problems I didn't know how to do. The final was also pretty hard but at least it was an in person 3-hour sitting, which was much preferred over the format of the midterm. This class honestly sucks a lot, but you have to do it. If you're deciding to take it with Aviad or with Moses and Nima, I'd say that taking it with Moses and Nima is slightly better, but you're still going to have to work hard. Go to office hours and sections to help you get through the homeworks. Exams are pretty hit or miss.
2	It is definitely fast paced, and the quarter I took it (Winter 2022) seemed especially hard compared to previous quarters. The lectures and problem sets take a non-trivial amount of time, and there is a PSET every week. The midterm and final are also very difficult.
2	Make sure you review the slides after lecture, and if you watch recorded lectures asynchronously, pause to check your understanding. The midterm and final are very tough.
2	Not a great class. Only take it if you absolutely have to (in which case I feel sorry for you).
2	Very tough
2	This is a tricky course. There is a lot of content and the midterm and final are definitely hard. It is doable if you keep up with lecture, go to office hours and read the lecture notes.
2	The content of this course is really interesting and essential for CS majors, but the teaching team felt a little messy this quarter. It felt like the priority was on making students work rather than helping students learn. Moses tends to be a more clear lecturer than Nima, but lots of lectures just have too much content to fit into a single 90 minutes. I could not get through problem sets without OH.
2	This is not a very fun course and a substantial amount of work. It was pretty organized and well-taught. You have to take it to go through the CS core so keep your head up and you'll get through it. Make sure you find a strong support system in the class (friends and TAs) to get through it.
2	This course will probably take up most of your time. Make sure to take it with easier courses!
2	This is a very tough course. It is not easy. The content is confusing, and takes a lot of time to wrap your head around. It is a fun class to take but be prepared for long PSETS and struggles in understanding material. It is very rewarding, however!
2	As a core cs class, you have to take it and you will be better after taking it. However, if you have to take it with Moses and/or Nima it definitely highlights so many pain points in the CS department. This class can really kill the joy for CS. For reference, I'm on the systems track. There is a way to teach difficult content in a EfairE effective way. This class did not do this. In fact, this has been a class my least favorite class of the entire core (except 109). Lectures are horrible. Bruh up on the different types of algorithms (youTube, geeks4geeks), 103 (reviewing old psets), and 109 (in depth 109 review needed!! this class can get unnecessarily heavy on the 109). Moses and Nima are very intelligent and want people to succeed, but don't actually teach. Lecture is a bunch of crammed slides with dense material and very little time to understand it before the next pset is due. Homework is unreasonably challenging, half my time was spent just trying to understand what they were asking/talking about. Go to Office Hours early, because OH at the end of the week is SO AWFULLY unhelpful. Find a good TA and make time to go to their OH and/or section because you will waste so much time just trying to understand what they're asking - just to be wrong.  
2	Conceptually, much different from other theory/CS courses. Be prepared to think about algorithms a lot
2	This is a very difficult class. Think of it like a harder version of CS 103 but without the scrupulous grading critiques. Moses was a great lecturer and in hindsight, I think I learned the most from him as well as Jose and Jerry, two of the amazing TAs we had this quarter. The problem with this class is that the examples given in lecture don't prepare you at all for the homework problems. I basically had to rely on office hours for 70% of the homeworks this quarter. On the other hand, although I probably should've went to a few office hours when I took 103, the homeworks were doable without it, which I think is fair. The midterm was insanely difficult, and it definitely gives an advantage to people who have the full two days to work on it, as it is practically another homework assignment. I find it incredible they actually expected us to finish that test in 3 hours. I only had a day to work on it and didn't even finish the last problem. The final was definitely more fair, although the dynamic programming problem is just way too hard to give for an in-person timed exam. Overall, this is a required course so for CS majors you probably don't have any choice. As for other majors, be aware that this course is a challenge.
2	I liked Moses' style of lecturing and I felt that typically I understood his lectures meanwhile I really did not like Nima's style of lecturing. I think the best part of this class is when they let us have PSET partners for submissions, when that happened this class became so much more bearable. Aside from that I think this class starts off not too bad and then you hit dynamic programming and things become a lot harder than they need to be. My biggest piece of advice is try to know like 3-4 people who are also taking this class because that will really save you in the end.
2	Good course, definitely take it
2	Moses and Nima are great lecturers but the problem sets are often too hard to do own your own. Come into this class with a study group or prepare to go to office hours every week. The grading rubric is harsh and very specific so be prepared. Course policy is a bit weird since they encourage students to discuss answers during office hours.
2	This course has very interesting material and the problems that your are solving are genuinely engaging. However, i think the administration of the course was a bit off this year. The cheating scandal disrupted the flow of things, making it so that we didn't receive feedback on the last three assignments before the final. Of course I understand that the TAs would have to go through every single midterm to check for signs of Honor Code violations. However, this came at the expense of all students. I felt like online office hours were really helpful with the PSETs and understanding material. In person office hours felt a bit more disjointed which was weird. One other thing that I didn't really like was the amount of hand-waving during proofs, which made it a bit more difficult to understand the reasoning behind certain algorithms. This does make it easier for us to digest content, but made it a bit harder to study for the exam where its unclear what information we need to know. The exams are difficult, but they can be difficult for everyone. Remember that its okay not to know everything on the exam and you can still do fine! Just try to actively enjoy the material and talk to the TAs/professors if you have questions.
2	Great and interesting material. Course is well established with great lecture notes, which makes learning the material easier. Course instructors are not the most pleasant people, but TAs are wonderful.
2	Great for coding interviews, start your hws on time + go to OH
2	Definitely learned a lot. It was A LOT of work, and I don't think the instruction was always the best/clearest - but i still learned a lot. Definitely go to office hours, there were a lot of times that the pset questions weren't super clear - or there were key details for the question that you would miss/not be aware were important without going to OH.
2	This class is well taught and there are a lot of resources for doing well. The midterm+final format is a lot less stressful than the weekly quiz format offered in other quarters.
2	Keep up with lectures, as we move through concepts quickly.
2	You probably have to take it for your major anyways.  If you don't there's not too much of a point.
2	Good class, just everything that is taught can be found online and explained a little bit shorter. The expectations aren't super clear, (ie. for homeworks, whether we needed to write formal proofs, pseudocode or just an explanation, etc). and grading didn't always align with expectations. Also for the midterm, when they said that it would take 3 hours in the 48 hour window and most students took over 15 hours to complete it. Make sure you go to office hours to understand what the teaching team is asking.
2	The teaching staff was more concerned with ensuring academic honesty than over well being and learning for the class. Some CA's would not help at all at office hours while others would. Overall, it sucks that CS students need to take this for a requirement because the class is so poorly taught.
2	This class is terrible. It's a real shame because it's a required course in the CS core and the concepts are really interesting. The professors (Moses and Nima) are probably the worst instructors I've ever had. Not only do they suck at teaching, they also have no empathy for students at all. The biggest example of this was the insane 22 page take home midterm they gave us that they told us would take 3 hours, but took more like 12 (literally, not an exaggeration). When hundreds of students cheated, instead of taking any responsibility for creating an environment that promoted cheating (the instructors literally broke the honor code), they just said how disappointed they were in all of us with no recognition in their own faults. So one piece of advice: I don't know about the other instructors, but if you have to take this class DO NOT take it with Moses or Nima. Terrible experience.
2	CS 161 has the potential to be an unbelievably interesting class. Unfortunately, the winter quarter offering fell short of that. I found the instruction under Professor Charikar to be very solid, while I found myself learning less in Professor Anari's lectures. The homework assignments were long and quite challenging, and while I learned a lot from many of the problems, I feel like they could have been shorter. The take-home midterm was borderline madness E the professors designed a test that many of my classmates could not finish after 12 hours of work, and a sginificant number of students cheated on it. The final was difficult, but much more fair / doable.
2	Can be a lot, but just go to office hours a lot to get traction!
2	This is one of the most useful classes I have taken at Stanford. The class is tough but it is definitely worth it.
2	The lectures do not coincide with the PSETs: the PSETs are much harder. There is quite the disconnect between how simple the lectures seem and how difficult the PSETs are. Also, just note, probably one of the most difficult midterms I've taken at Stanford. 22 pages take home...
2	Challenging course but better if you attend in person and use all of the resources they give to you!
2	Dont
2	Midterm was extremely difficult because it was take home and did not take the allotted number of times. The first few PSETs can be quite difficult and the difficulty of each PSET is not uniform. However, in-person office hours are really good and the TAs were knowledgeable so definitely take advantage of that.
2	Required for major, some interesting but not one of those classes you come out thinking 'I'm stoked I took this'.
2	The lectures are really good, and the concept checks are very challenging but low-stakes (because you won't be graded for them). Algorithms is as much an art as it is a science, so it shouldn't be surprising to find the first few psets to be very hard. In particular, the second problem set is the rite of passage, so watch out!
2	The content of this course is really interesting and essential for CS majors, but the teaching team felt a little messy this quarter. It felt like the priority was on making students work rather than helping students learn. Moses tends to be a more clear lecturer than Nima, but lots of lectures just have too much content to fit into a single 90 minutes. I could not get through problem sets without OH.
2	This is not a very fun course and a substantial amount of work. It was pretty organized and well-taught. You have to take it to go through the CS core so keep your head up and you'll get through it. Make sure you find a strong support system in the class (friends and TAs) to get through it.
2	This is a no-nonsense class as introduction to algorithms and algorithmic analysis. Much of the work is straightforward from what's learned, but be prepared to think.
2	This class is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken at Stanford. I required office hours to do every problem set but the TAs are great and so supportive. Be prepared for VERY hard exams. The lecture's aren't super well taught but if you are confused about concepts there are more than enough office hours and sections to get your questions answered.
2	asf
2	"Took with Nima and Moses. This class sucks. It is sad, because it has the potential of being super interesting, and the content is actually relevant (esp for coding interviews). But instruction sucks and you end up wasting so much time doing self-learning, chasing around office hours for the *few* TAs who are actually good to try to understand what you are supposed to do in the weekly psets which are really disconnected from lectures, and the exams are very hard. While this class is called ""DESIGN and ANALYSIS"" of algorithms, all they do is make you memorize a few famous algorithms and then formally analyze and prove them. They do not teach you any actual design skills and just expect you to come up with crazy intuitions during psets and exams to design certain algorithms. This quarter, they gave us a take-home midterm for 48h which was ""designed to be taken in 3h"" but most students worked on it for >10h and still could not finish. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to (in which case, I am so sorry for you)."
2	Moses and Nima are good lecturers with great slides and explained hard or nuanced concepts well within a short lecture time. There were some instances in which the proof or explanation of something was being left for students to figure out, which was a huge contrast from 107 or 103 where we were walked through each step clearly. Response times and quality on Ed were unpredictable. Some TAs wrote impressively good responses. At other times, replies were slow compared to the other CS core classes, and most of the times, responses would come from other students. The professors and TAs would purposely refrain from answering some questions in hopes that other students would chip in. There were cases in which questions about the HW were left unanswered days after the HW was due. Concept checks were a good metric but provide solutions for them in future quarters. Even though section is optional and one section was recorded, I wish more section times were offered. This was the only CS class where the TA consistently got through the entire section handout, so kudos for that!I LIVED in office hours for the latter half of this course. TAs were very helpful and did comprehensive walkthroughs for some problems. There were often big differences between the TA's levels of helpfulness or even barebones interpretation of HW questions though - example, on whether a rigorous proof is required, or which approach to take to solve a question, which made things frustrating and confusing.Problem sets were helpful for learning the material. Some were too long, one had unreasonably complicated questions, and a fair amount of ambiguities. At one point, I felt that HW scores were not a representation of one's ability but rather how much time they have to go to office hours and squeeze out answers or clarifications from the TAs. HWs need to be designed better to remove such problems. HW grades could've been released in a more timely manner.The midterm was like a hackathon during the week. It was long with very tough questions, but I don't know how it could've been improved. So many students cheated, and I don't even know if all of them were identified, which is annoying. The midterm and final were both on the difficult end. Everything is left up to the curve and how your peers do, which isn't ideal since some students already know this material from tech interviews or competitive math.Everyone talks about 107 and 103, but 161's difficulty can catch you off guard. Part of this is because algorithms is inherently a hard class.All in all, I learned a lot from this course about a number of important topics in algorithms. Take 103 before. This course is already hard enough if you know proofs, so make sure you are comfortable with induction, contradiction, and other concepts from 103. 109 is helpful for the randomized algo section but not much. Study for this course in advance. This course is so fast paced, and 4 weeks is not enough time to go from hearing the terms dynamic programming and greedy for the first time to confidently taking a final exam about them. Doing well on these topics so quickly takes an insane amount of practice or mathematical background.
2	Likely redundant for most students, but required for the major.
2	Great course that helps you develop a new way of thinking. Definitely go to section, and start early on the homework and assessments. Section leaders and teaching team were fantastic and very helpful throughout.
2	The course is very well taught and the TAs are incredible.  Moreover, all the knowledge gained is very practical - you learn problem solving skills.
2	algorithms :)
2	Go to office hours and engage with other students!
2	Go to office hours. The grading is very harsh and you're unlikely to do well without attending office hours and getting clarification from a TA on the expected answers and what is needed to fulfill the rubric. A small mistake could cost you a lot of marks as there's almost no credit given for partial solutions. Also, make sure you stay on top of the forums, often the homework questions are unclear, and you might need to rewrite your solutions after the clarifications are posted.
2	Don' take it in winter
2	I liked Moses' style of lecturing and I felt that typically I understood his lectures meanwhile I really did not like Nima's style of lecturing. I think the best part of this class is when they let us have PSET partners for submissions, when that happened this class became so much more bearable. Aside from that I think this class starts off not too bad and then you hit dynamic programming and things become a lot harder than they need to be. My biggest piece of advice is try to know like 3-4 people who are also taking this class because that will really save you in the end.
2	Good course, definitely take it
2	Great class. Can be difficult at times but take advantage of office hours and the course staff.
2	Moses and Nima are great lecturers but the problem sets are often too hard to do own your own. Come into this class with a study group or prepare to go to office hours every week. The grading rubric is harsh and very specific so be prepared. Course policy is a bit weird since they encourage students to discuss answers during office hours.
2	If you're gonna take this class, be ready for extremely long and hard PSETs and insanely difficult exams. Try not to take it with Nima & Moses if you can.
2	This class is literally the only reason I got through 161. Avery is the most dedicated TA I've had in my 3 years studying CS at Stanford, and not only went above and beyond to provide us with help and resources but also did an amazing job supporting us as humans. I was nervous about how the 2 hour section would add to my workload for the quarter, but the time was insanely productive in helping me understand the material and apply it on the homeworks; I always looked forward to section. He was also super responsive to student feedback and was genuinely committed to tailoring his teaching to our particular class cohort. I felt like I had a community and a support group, which I really needed in 161. If you are in doubt, TAKE THIS CLASS!
2	Avery is an amazing teacher! This was a super helpful class. I highly recommend for anyone that struggles to grasp cs concepts on the first go. Avery walks you through any conceptual issues you have and explains material in a super helpful manner!!
2	Really great help for 161, I suggest taking it even if you think you're advanced enough because it just gives you exta resources/time spent learning/engaging with the material
2	It is difficult.
2	It is not as difficult as people make it seem. But keep up with it through the quarter and you should do great .
2	Make sure you start the homework as soon as possible, do not wait until the last minute.
2	Difficult and very fast paced but you learn a lot. Take with Gene if possible,
2	After lecture/every week, take a little bit of time to go through your notes and the provided annotated notes. This will definitely help with understanding things conceptually through understanding the types of problems you might confront.
2	"This course is definitely not easy. However, I don't think it's the horror story that many people describe it to be. It's just so fast paced which is very unfortunate. It is hard to soak in what they are teaching because they throw so much at you and give you no time to absorb it. Find friends to help you through this class. Exams are tough and don't always match what is taught in the course - you are expected to ""apply"" what you have learned which can be frustrating. If you are willing to put in the time, you will succeed. Gene Kim is very entertaining and a great professor who helps ease the pain."
2	"This course is by no means ""easy,"" but I would recommend it to everyone at Stanford. Even if you are majoring in English or Art Practice, you should still seize the opportunity to take this class while you can. In a way, you learn all the math you ever have before college in ten weeks, from adding to graphing representations of 3 dimensional figures, but through the perspective of vectors which are honestly just super cool. Even if you hate math, you should want to know the things taught in this course, or at least, appreciate them a little more. It can be a lot of work, but its worth it."
2	take it if necessary. hard course but worthwhile!
2	The course moves extremely fast, which makes it very difficult to digest concepts without additional review. Always go back over the lectures and watch 3blue1brown videos for a conceptual and visual understanding of the topics. If you put in the extra effort, the course is manageable.
2	Ensure you read the text before class even if itEs optional. YouEll probably feel very confused and defeated many times during the class but you have to put in the extra effort on your own to going over notes and understanding. You learn a lot from doing the homework
2	I definitely think that this is a must for Stanford students. As challenging as the coursework is, I definitely found some enjoyable elements in both the content as well as the instructors themselves.
2	Definitely has a reputation at Stanford, but it is within reach! Definitely make use of all the resources that are there to help you (section, office hours, SUMO, etc.) Very interesting material that has tangible real-world applications.
2	Math 51 is a well-organized course with a great learning plan that allows you to expand on the past topics you have learned and continue growing your understanding of an idea. I like how everything seemed to connect in some way, from vectors to column spaces to orthogonal bases. Overall, this was a really interesting course!
2	This class is difficult. Requires a lot of time for psets and studying. Reading the textbook is really useful - exams sometimes will cover topics very briefly mentioned in class. Watch supplemental videos in addition to class if linear algebra/multi is new to you or you need extra support.
2	If you are only taking this course because it is a pre-req, beware! It is very difficult and if you are not naturally inclined to be good at math you are going to have to put a lot of work into it. While it is unavoidable for many majors, I'd suggest taking a lighter course load while you take this class.
2	To be completely honest, this class is hard. I have had no experience with linear algebra or multivariable calculus before. When taking the class, I feel like everyone else around me already learned everything or learned at least 1 topic that was discussed. The material was entirely new to me, so I struggled so much. I recommend going to discussion or at least doing the worksheets. Also, make sure you understand the psets. Expect to struggle a bit more on the midterm than the psets. I also recommend taking it in the spring or with a schedule where you can actually focus on this class if you are new to the topics.
2	The weekly psets can be somewhat time-consuming, so try to start them early.
2	This class is hard. Understand that a lot of the people who take this class have already taken similar classes in high school so do not be discouraged if you don't do as well as you may be used to. It's a hard class and it covers a lot of content in a very short amount of time (a chapter a day). Take CME 100 instead if your major allows. That being said, the instructors are super awesome, it's just hard content.
2	This class is very hard. There is a ton of content squeezed into 10 weeks and definitely not enough time to cover all of it. Because it moves so quickly, it is hard to really understand and digest topics because very little time is spent on each one. As a result, the class was quite overwhelming as I always felt like I was playing catch-up. I understand that this course is a requirement for many majors - and some the content actually is quite interesting - but overall it was a very stressful experience due to the structure and pace of the course. The problem sets and exams were very difficult as well. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are super passionate about math and/or need it for a major requirement. That being said, Jinyoung Park is a great instructor. She is funny, kind, explains concepts well, and is very receptive to questions. She definitely made the class better.
2	honestly, do it. will it be hard? no doubt. but jinyoung is such a good teacher, no matter how difficult the content is, youEll always be able to walk out of class with a smile. study hard, use office hours, find a pset group, and go all out in this course to succeed. the payoff will be priceless
2	Definitely take the course if you have a strong STEM background and want to continue your STEM studies. I would say the organization of the class could be better, especially in that a lot of material is covered in the last 2 weeks compared to the first 8, which increases stress toward finals week in my opinion. I do think the quality of instruction is great however - Prof. Jinyoung is fantastic!
2	hard. go to class. don't skip section. jinyoung park is great and casually hilarious <3
2	This is a challenging course but an essential one to take.
2	Do the textbook reading and make sure you understand the concepts after each and every lecture because the content moves very fast. Also work through the homework early and as you go because doing problems will help you understand the book to a greater extent.
2	It is kind of rough, but so necessary to take so many future classes. The class would be manageable if it moved slower because you can't really afford to get behind for more than 1 lecture. Reading the textbook is key in this course and personally, I really benefited from actually going to all lectures and sections.
2	This course is intense but well taught. I would recommend going to all lectures, discussion sections, and starting problem sets early.
2	Make sure to go to section as section problems help on the homework and tests.
2	Very difficult, overwhelming, go to office hours.
2	Not great but needed for prerequisites. Lucronovic explains things well but Gene has more examples which is often more helpful.
2	It goes fast. Do the readings beforehand.
2	It's a very fast paced course where you are constantly new material, make sure to review notes every week to ensure you understand all the concepts
2	The quality of instruction for Math 51 is highly dependent on the instructor. I had Mark Lucianovic,who unfortunately wasn't the best lecturer and left me behind other Math 51 students. Please use 3Blue1Brown to visualize the linear algebra portion of the class! Math 21 was not necessary at all for this course from what I've seen. Midterms and Finals this quarter were pretty similar to the practices (some a bit harder and some easier). Keep up with section, do lots of practice problems, go to office hours, and you'll be set. Not the nightmare most people say it is & doable without previous Linear/MVC experience.
2	Theoretically, the course content is not that hard. However, the textbook/lectures can make the content a little confusing, so ask questions! Every lecture also goes overtime, so keep that in mind when scheduling other classes. I highly recommend finding a good section leader who will reteach lecture content in section. Lastly, if you have to isolate for any reason, it is important to know that lectures are not recorded and they will not Zoom you in. It's up to you to learn the material on your own if you miss lecture/section!
2	I would definitely recommend it especially if you are looking into cs or econ
2	this is the most fast paced course you could possibly take. office hours are a must, and quality of instruction and content varies by instructor.
2	This class is a fun class
2	Lucianovic is a really nice guy, but it's not rare that he doesn't make it all the way through the lecture notes. You'll have to teach yourself a lot of the material, but the psets are honestly really helpful and the textbook is probably the best math textbook I've ever had -- conveys the important material well, lowkey funny at times, has great resources for studying. I didn't have any multivar or linear algebra experience coming into this class and it honestly wasn't too bad, although the final did kick my butt.
2	No
2	I guess take it. It's a hard course, but if you put in the time and do a lot of practice questions you should be fine. Attending lecture is really important too.
2	Math 51 is a great class. If you stay on top of the reading and engage with lecture it feels fairly doable. The textbook is incredibly well written and thorough and really complements the examples given in lecture (take with Gene Kim if you want very example heavy lectures).
2	Although this course is famously challenging at Stanford, I would still encourage future students to take it. After all, we are not here for easy things. As a potential engineering major, I was considering between the CME series and the Math series. After talking to my UAD and the professors of my potential major, I figured out that taking either of them would be both helpful for an engineering major. If you have similar concerns, don't worry too much about which series is the best/the right one. Start the psets early and discuss with peers. Go to lectures and discussions. Preview and review right before and after the lectures. Do the examples in the textbook. Redo the problems on the lecture worksheets. This course is fun; the problem is just it has a lot to teach, and sometimes I had to sacrifice some details to keep up with the lectures.
2	It's a ton of content, but super interesting stuff. Make sure to start the problem sets early, as the pacing will make more sense with the lectures and you'll have more room to study for midterms.
2	THIS CLASS IS HORRIBLY TAUGHT. THEY TEACH NOTHING IN LECTURES. YOU LEARN EVERYTHING BY READING THE TEXTBOOK. Don't waste your time by going to lectures. Just read the textbook.
2	This class is extremely intense and would recommend to those who feel extremely prepared for higher-level mathematical concepts. The class also assumes students know some of the content prior to exams.
2	Definitely take this course. It's required for most majors, and it's also incredibly useful in so many fields (if you're an econ major, I highly recommend taking it for a letter grade, since you've got to know these concepts well). It's organized and instructed quite well. The class has a daunting reputation, but it's truly not that bad. There is a wealth of support, from TA's, instructors, and other students. If you put in the work, you can definitely come out of it with a good grade. The first 7 weeks are significantly easier than the last three weeks though, so be prepared for it to ramp up. And although the concepts can be hard, the tests end up far easier, and they're pretty lenient about partial credit. Take the course, but it's not all that bad.
2	This goes without saying but do not take this course unless it is required for your major or unless you actually like math (although this course may change your mind on the latter, and if you're unsure of your major and MATH 51 only *might* be a prereq for one of the required classes, better to put it off). Way too much content crammed into ten weeks--the one-hour lectures are never enough time to even cover half of the example problems Gene puts in his notes. The majority of the learning happens outside of lecture--I got the most out of reading the textbook, but studying looks different for everyone. And as confused as I was this quarter, what makes the least sense to me is the fact that the course administrators/instructors refused to record lectures or allow COVID-positive students to Zoom into lectures.
2	This is a great class. Truly satisfying at the end.
2	Hard class, don't procrastinate
2	This course is hard! It is definitely the hardest class I've taken at Stanford, especially as someone with no experience in multivariable calculus or linear algebra. The course moves extremely fast. By the time you start to understand a concept, the class has already moved on to the next two chapters. I would recommend that you do not take this class at the same time as any other difficult courses, as Math 51 requires a large time commitment and my hinder your abilities to study for other courses.
2	try not to
2	This class was very difficult but I learned a lot about matrices!
2	a lot and very fast paced. Take time to go over material and absorb it for things to make sense. Intuitive though
2	Remember to read the textbook to conceptually understand this class since most topics are hard to grasp by just going to lecture alone. Definitely use the office hours offered as a supplement to your PSET understanding
2	If you want to obtain a good grade in Math 51 is definitely a strong 5 units. The instruction is fine, but you will have to do a lot of the learning yourself outside of class. Homework is application of theory learned in class to problems rather than just learning how to work through problems. Section is not mandatory, but can be helpful some weeks.
2	Really difficult class, DO NOT TAKE WITH PHYSICS. A killer combination unless you're on top of your game or have seen either material before.
2	If you're considering taking this course, you probably need it. Just take it -- go to every lecture and try to do as much of the psets by yourself, they really really help your understanding.
2	Make linear algebra more confusing than is necessary by combining with multivariable calculus. Simpler ways to solve problems are not covered (like cross product) in favor of more rigerous and generally applicable methods
2	It is hard especially the second midterm) but it will be ok.
2	Jinyoung Park was an amazing lecturer she is funny and to the point and knows what she is doing. I believe she was a new instructor this quarter, but if you have the opportunity to take the class with her I highly recommend. Noah Cohan is also probably the best TA ever just generally.
2	Excruciating but mandatory for basically all STEM/Social Sciences. Get it over with ASAP.
2	I think that's it's important to keep in mind, you are going to get an output based on the effort that you put into this class. That means, that if you are looking to succeed, there are enough avenues that will help you get there. Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that a large majority of the grade for this class is either midterms or the final, but make sure that you are focusing in on the homework and are able to understand the things that you are doing in it.
2	This course is very fast paced. Stay on top of the readings and assignments, and use office hours early on.
2	It's a difficult course and not very rewarding. Stay on top of the material, watch 3Blue1Brown, and take it with a light quarter.
2	The class provides a really strong and interesting foundation in linear algebra (from matrix operations to eigenvalues/eigenvectors and Hessians) and multivariable calculus (mainly partial derivatives) - it is a time commitment and requires dedication, but is also extremely rewarding!
