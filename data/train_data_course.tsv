0	TAKE THIS COURSE!! No matter what major you are, it's an extremely insightful and fun course! The structure of the course and the way it's taught is extremely effective. As someone who had never considered computer science in college, I'm not considering a major in computer science and taking more computer science courses at Stanford in the future.	CS-106A
0	It's a great course!	CS-106A
0	Take it! The teaching team do a great job of introducing computer science principles to the students, and the course is definitely friendly to people with no coding experience.	CS-106A
0	I think everyone at Stanford should take 106a. I took it with Nick, who is probably the best instructor I've ever had at Stanford. CS can definitely get hard at times, but it's evident that Nick is very thoughtful about his teaching and implementing effective practice into class time. Also, I really appreciated that Nick mentions that stuff is hard. It really helped me realize that the fast pace of Stanford DOES make things more difficult, but that just means I'm learning the way Stanford wants me to	CS-106A
0	Hard if you don't have a CS background, as it moves very fast. If your good at focusing for long periods and working with puzzles, this is a good class for you	CS-106A
0	If you want to learn about CS take this course	CS-106A
0	Take it, even if you are not considering computer science. It is very well taught	CS-106A
0	Great intro to programming! Highly recommend you take this, even if you don't plan on going into programming or stuff of that manneer.	CS-106A
0	This instructor is very knowledgeable and conveys the material well. The course is logically structured and easy to follow. Due dates are clear and enough time is given to complete the assignments.	CS-106A
0	Don't get discouraged if you don't understand right away. When it feels like everyone knows what they're doing, I promise you're not alone and the professors, TAs and section leaders are cognizant of the steep learning curve as well.	CS-106A
0	Really great class. Its so well organized and the assignments are really applicable to real life and fun. Great intro course, and pretty accessible/easy.	CS-106A
0	THE intro-level (CS) course at Stanford. Designed from the bottom-up to be extremely accessible with additionally so many support systems built-in that it feels like you can comfortably forget about stressing over your performance and spend more time focusing on learning and developing new skills. Beyond that, can be conceptually very interesting (especially if coming in with no prior awareness of programming) and rewarding (psets are all applications-based and it's really cool to look back after each one to appreciate what you've just built with your own hands). Would highly recommend this course (Nick is a great teacher too), if not for a great perspective on CS, then at least as a very rewarding 5 units of developing a rewarding skill.	CS-106A
0	Fun way to dip your toes in CS!	CS-106A
0	CS106A is a fun introduction to computer science and programming. The exams are relatively easy, the instructors throw no curveballs, and overall the course is designed to set you up to succeed. Despite the large number of people taking the class, there are still many opportunities for one-on-one interaction, which I personally thought was a testament to how efficiently and brilliantly the course is structured. Definitely a fun and enjoyable time - even if you don't plan on continuing with CS in the future, the skills you learn in 106A are valuable far beyond programming!	CS-106A
0	Take it! Everyone and their mother has taken this class, so there is no shortage of people who can give you advice.	CS-106A
0	Take it. I came into Stanford with no CS knowledge and as a sophomore English major I loved this course more than anything. It wasn't easy, but there were so many resources that I was able to enjoy learning something completely and I could feel so proud of myself whenever I actually got something done. Nick Parlante is also the best at making you comfortable with struggling through coding, even though he obviously finds it easy himself. Loved everything about it and I'm glad I took it!	CS-106A
0	As graduate student who avoided taking any CS courses during undergrad because programming/coding seemed so intimidating, I can't express how glad I am that I finally took this class. This is one of, if not the most well-taught class I have ever taken. Beyond the practical knowledge I got from this class, I'm just so thrilled that programming doesn't seem so mysterious/scary anymore. If you're thinking about taking this class - do it!	CS-106A
0	The classic Stanford class. As someone who has never programmed, it was very challenging and time consuming, but you have a whole new set of skills by the end! Make sure you go to lair - it is super helpful and where I did much of my learning.	CS-106A
0	I believe that this course is not beginner-friendly; beware.	CS-106A
0	Take this class. So well done!	CS-106A
0	Take it! It is one of the best coding courses I have taken. Nick is good at teaching and the lecture is very organized.	CS-106A
0	Very helpful!	CS-106A
0	This course is very accessible for those who don't have any coding experience. I would highly recommend taking it and deciding whether or not you like CS. While the assignments do take a lot of effort and time, it is possible to complete them on time. Also LAIR is a great resource if you are stuck on any P-sets. This course is definitely not a walk in the park, especially if you have never looked at code in your life, but it is super rewarding and it gives you a skill that is very useful in todays modern age.	CS-106A
0	Well structured, they have been perfecting this class for years and it shows	CS-106A
0	Great course, I think everyone no matter what their major is at stanford should take this class. Very impressed with the amount of resources for student help and I think the CS department did a great job. I just started coding python during week 1 of this class and now I am pretty good at it. TAKE THIS CLASS.	CS-106A
0	this class is designed for beginners and to help beginners succeed. midterm/final are not bad and your grade will probably be fine even if you don't put in that much effort, but that being said, if you really want to get a lot out of the course, make sure to spend a lot of time refining concepts and doing psets.	CS-106A
0	Take it! ItEs the best class IEve taken at Stanford so far!	CS-106A
0	This was a great course! Even though I didn't need to take this course for my major, CS here is popular for a reason and the introductory CS class is very beginner friendly and informative. I definitely recommend taking it regardless of major, since it gives you basic skills that might be helpful down the line, and honestly it was a lot of fund and very gratifying!	CS-106A
0	Pay attention to lectures! Easy course, lots of fun.	CS-106A
0	Ask questions when youEre confused	CS-106A
0	I would 100% recommend taking this course to anyone who might be interested. The teaching is excellent and the course material is fun and interesting!	CS-106A
0	Take it, its really hard tho.	CS-106A
0	If you have no coding experience, go to lecture and office hours because the class moves fast	CS-106A
0	"This class is really rewarding to take! I took this class because after taking Chem 31M I was so discouraged I dropped organic chem, which I was supposed to take winter quarter. This class really helped me regain my confidence in my ability to problem solve, it's NOT an easy class (lots of people say that but this class is definitely a 5 unit class, it can be even harder than other stem classes here because there's no textbook or methodical way to learn to code), but there are lots of resources! Don't be surprised if you find yourself spending 4 hours at LAIR some nights because you can't even get the code to run on your own. That's part of the process, and it makes the midterms seem so much better. I really genuinely hope I can take 106B sometime, I can't take it next quarter because of PreMed reqs, but am definitely hoping to take it sometime down the road because of my great experience with 106A! But no seriously, I used to feel so bad because the rep was that 106A was ""easy,"" but coding is like learning a new language. It takes practice, but will eventually flow naturally! Just don't let your guard down with this class and enjoy the process and should be fine!"	CS-106A
0	Extraordinary class, take it	CS-106A
0	Great class. Everyone takes it. Well organized, which I wasn't expecting for such a large class. Go to the same section each week!	CS-106A
0	I really recommend this course! It is easy and is a great intro to CS. I had no experience and I found this course to be very accommodating to me.	CS-106A
0	I would absolutely recommend taking this course. I'm an English major, so basically about as far from CS as you can get, and I still feel like this has been one of the best classes I've ever taken in my life. Not only is it well taught and surprisingly fun, but it also provides a skillset and perspective that I feel will remain incredibly useful regardless of whether you choose to take another CS class in the future.	CS-106A
0	It's a fantastically taught class! Even if it's not required for your major, you should take it just to have a bit of insight into the world of CS. I knew nothing coming in and I've learned so much!	CS-106A
0	It is a fairly simple class and all of the classes are recorded so it is nearly asynchronous.	CS-106A
0	ItEs a must-take class for all Stanford students! A very rewarding class that is taught well and isnEt particularly time consuming	CS-106A
0	This course is very well taught and if you have any interest at all in trying CS then absolutely take it. Pay attention in lectures and assignments shouldn't be too bad and the exams are very fair.	CS-106A
0	Go to all the lectures.	CS-106A
0	This class is very well structured.	CS-106A
0	I highly recommend taking this class, especially if you have never coded before. You'll gain exposure to an amazing field and possibly discover a passion for it. There are so many resources that will help you along the way too.	CS-106A
0	Pace yourself on the homework assignments. Just reading over the directions the day it's posted is a good start because you can think about it here and there for the rest of the week.	CS-106A
0	take it!	CS-106A
0	Nice class	CS-106A
0	Great intro to computer science and fantastic instruction	CS-106A
0	This class was super fun. Don't take it with a heavy course load though. It can be a lot of work, especially if you have no cs background.	CS-106A
0	I really liked this course! It was a lot of fun, and nick was fun and engaging. Not too challenging, but very rewarding. Give yourself 2-3 days for assignments, and try to go to lair when you need it!	CS-106A
0	It's a great intro course to python. Just make sure to watch lectures and ask questions when you get the chance	CS-106A
0	Homeworks are very hard if you have little or no coding background experience.	CS-106A
0	Really take time to work through p-sets and the experimental server	CS-106A
0	Course is very beginner friendly! Beneficial to have a group of friends to take class with, if you are a slow learner like me. Hearing other people think about CS topics in different ways will engage your learning. Weeks 3-5 are definitely the roughest, plan your time accordingly. Take advantage of LaIR, not just debugging, but conceptual help too!!	CS-106A
0	.	CS-106A
0	Take this, I took it with no prior experience and it was an awesome intro.	CS-106A
0	It's a fun class to take, I did learn a lot about how coding works. As a student who had never had any coding experience prior to this class, I would say that most of the topics are engaging and Nick Parlante is a fun instructor that sprinkles bits of humor into his lectures. However, he is also extremely experienced, so for a beginner (like me), it would sometimes be difficult to apply what we learned in lectures to the homework. Nonetheless, I would encourage people to take this class, but just know that it will be more difficult for those who have little to no experience.	CS-106A
0	It is a great course, you will learn a lot. A huge portion of the class has no background in coding and still did great. It is a bit fast-paced but still the homeworks are fun and the tests are super fair	CS-106A
0	It is a fantastic introduction to computer science and I highly recommend it.	CS-106A
0	Best course. Must take it while you are at Stanford.	CS-106A
0	You probably will	CS-106A
0	I really enjoyed the class, it is really well organized and challenging.	CS-106A
0	I had no background in coding by the course is very well designed and makes it easy for someone with no experience. Professor Parlante is excellent and there are abundant resources to help students.	CS-106A
0	Take it!	CS-106A
0	TAKE IT. You won't regret it. It's best class I've ever taken.	CS-106A
0	Really recommend	CS-106A
0	This course is an amazing introduction to computer science, friendly to students of all backgrounds. I would 100% recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in cs. Plus Nick Parlante is an amazing lecturer with funny jokes.	CS-106A
0	As long as you attend lecture and understand the homeworks, you will do well in this class. Well-structure and lecture notes are always online as well.	CS-106A
0	This class is very challenging but is definitely something you should take if you want to get the introduction to computer science. The teacher also explains all the concepts very well.	CS-106A
0	Great introduction to coding for those who have absolutely no experience in it. Lectures are extremely clear and Nick is a great professor. If you like little puzzles, you'll enjoy this class.	CS-106A
0	Amazing class for someone wanted to get started in python or wants a review. I had some coding familiarity going in and was taking the class for fun, and it's indeed super fun. The teacher is engaging, the assignments are well designed, and the midterm/ final are fair and reflective of what is covered in class. A must take!	CS-106A
0	This is a great introduction to Python programming. While you won't finish the course ready to do everything you might desire with Python, the class seems to lay a good foundation for the basics. I think it's a great place to start, especially if you are new to programming.	CS-106A
0	Very fun class, great teacher, exciting content!	CS-106A
0	It is very fast paced and you can get left behind quickly.	CS-106A
0	An excellent introduction to computer science. I entered the class with zero coding experience, and now exiting the class, I have a great deal of coding knowledge. The assignments are difficult but all very completable given enough effort. This is a must-take class for all Stanford students and although I don't plan on majoring in CS, I'm glad I took it.	CS-106A
0	Great intro to cs donEt be intimidated to take it	CS-106A
0	The course moves fast. Lectures, while they can be a bit dull, are super useful at understanding the content and progressing forward. Nick is also an incredible teacher, making lectures more interesting and including real world applications of how coding can be used.	CS-106A
0	If you are considering taking 106A, take it! CS 106A is a Stanford must-do at this point, and I've definitely seen that, with people from all different majors and educational backgrounds dabbling into coding through this class. If you have had previous experience, I would steer you away from taking the class and advise that you jump into 106B. Otherwise, the content will likely feel repetitive, slow, and boring. If you're new to programming, it's hard to predict how difficult the course will be. In essence, CS is just puzzle solving, so if that's something you're good at, you might excel; for others, you might find the class to be rather tough. Either way, give it a shot! If nothing else, you will walk away from this class a rather capable Python programer, which is an invaluable skill in today's economy.	CS-106A
0	Great professor, weird course format but definitely conducive to learning.	CS-106A
0	Will be very hard if you don't have any prior CS experience. Highly recommended going to OH, LiAR, and section.	CS-106A
0	Extremely well taught and very good for beginners. If you kind of know what you're doing, you might want to start at 106b.	CS-106A
0	CS106A with Nick Parlante is a fantastic class and very well taught. I had never taken any sort of programming before and was very nervous but found everything to be super approachable. If you have never coded before expect a bit of a learning curve, but everything is very doable. Take the time to sit down with the problem sets and figure them out. Exams are very doable and fair. I really ended up enjoying everything by the end.	CS-106A
0	This class was really fun; however, you cannot fall behind on work or you will get lost.	CS-106A
0	Take it!!! I was really nervous about taking this course but it's so well taught and has so many amazing resources to ensure that all students succeed!	CS-106A
0	I had no CS experience, and 106a was very manageable and quite fun. The class is so organized with tons of extra resources set up to support you. The lectures are very comprehensive with tons of examples. You get a lot of practice material for the midterm and final, both of which are very similar to the practice exam that they give you.	CS-106A
0	great, kind, thorough into to programming	CS-106A
0	Take this course with your friends! You can go to classes together and it'll motivate you to do better in the course. It doesn't matter if you've never coded before, you can still learn but go to office hours if you need help even if its on the first week. Also, stick to the pace! Always aim to submit before the late days but if you need to use it that's ok too!	CS-106A
0	As someone who has no experience with coding, this course was difficult but amazing. I feel like I learned so much. Despite not performing well on the final and struggling through the last few assignments, I am so grateful to have taken it.  You feel so accomplished.	CS-106A
0	This is a fantastic introductory course for people who have no coding experience. Nick is a fantastic lecturer, and class is always so engaging. I appreciate how he incorporates humor and quirk into his lectures. The gradual progression of the course material is so intentional in the sense that it builds off of previous knowledge. The homework assignments are very straight-forward and oftentimes the data being processed is very interesting.	CS-106A
0	If you have interests in coding, take this course. If you do not like coding but are required to take this course for your major, you will probably not enjoy it because of the nature of the subject, but the instruction is great. The environment of this course if very understanding and I have never been made to feel stupid for not understanding something.	CS-106A
0	Absolutely take this class! It is a great introduction to coding and a Stanford must.	CS-106A
0	This is a great class for figuring out if you want to do computer science.	CS-106A
0	Don't fret!  This isn't bad.  But, be prepared to work moderately hard.  Nothing was too difficult though.	CS-106A
0	This class is made really well to make the students get interested in CS.	CS-106A
0	Loved it	CS-106A
0	Nick is a fantastic lecturer, and Juliette and the Section Leaders all work so hard to make sure you can do your best. It's all very approachable and collaborative. It's very easy to skip lectures or even get distracted on your laptop during in-person class, but you really shouldn't because the lectures are so helpful. People say you can be a complete beginner and still thrive in this class, and that is absolutely true!	CS-106A
0	Great teaching instructions, material is interesting and informative, assignments can be rough and frustrating but results are often very fulfilling and cool	CS-106A
0	If you are interested in CS, take it. If not, I don't think it's worth the stress.	CS-106A
0	This is a great course if you've never done any coding before. It starts off with the basics and by the end of the quarter, you will have a good understanding of python and coding. The instructors are very helpful as well and really want to see you succeed.	CS-106A
0	This is a great course for being introduced to programming and computer science. If you have a programming background you probably don't need to take this, but it still can be useful.	CS-106A
0	It was a very fun class and I would recommend you take it.	CS-106A
0	This is great course as an introduction to coding in general and Python in particular. Weekly HWs which can be long but are well structured and important to learning the concepts taught in class.I have MATLAB experience so this was quite easy for me. I spent about 10 hours per week in total on this class. Someone brand new to CS would spend considerably more.	CS-106A
0	Great course! Learned a lot and showed that coding is a lot more accessible and less scary than it might seem.	CS-106A
0	do it	CS-106A
0	This course and its level of difficulty is completely dependent on your comfort with math and if you have previous experience with cs. This class is not very accessible to non-stem majors unless they have taken high-level math classes. The instruction can sometimes be spotty as Nick does not understand that some things must be explained more in depth and this can make it so you have to do a lot of self-teaching. Section is helpful if you have a good TA.	CS-106A
0	Great introductory course. The instruction is great, and there is tons of support at all times, especially when the material becomes difficult.	CS-106A
0	Take it with Nick Parlante. He is literally king energy. Super thorough in his instruction and really funny. Assignment's instructions are hard to understand and unclear at times, but if you know what it is asking, it will literally take you 45 minutes to do the whole thing.	CS-106A
0	You get out what you put in! Make the most of LaIR from the beginning!	CS-106A
0	This is a great class for anyone who has zero background of coding experience. The curriculum is well constructed and projects are super fun with detailed instructions. Sections are great and office hour is available.	CS-106A
0	great course, would recommend	CS-106A
0	"If you aren't interested in CS I probably wouldn't take it. I thought I should take a ""Stanford CS Class"" because of notoriety. In hindsight, I don't care how great the class is, if you don't care for the subject you won't want to be spending 15 hours a week on it."	CS-106A
0	It's a classic for a reason. Great instruction and a culture of helpfulness amongst students taking it.	CS-106A
0	Excellent course, very beginner friendly and accessible to people who haven't done coding before. Great teaching team. Mind as well take it, you're at Stanford.	CS-106A
0	I am not a CS major, and I absolutely loved the class! Nick Parlante is an amazing lecturer!! I can't rave about this class enough.	CS-106A
0	I would highly recommend taking it. It is a great intro to cs and you will learn a lot.	CS-106A
0	You can take this class even if you've never taken CS or aren't a CS major. Sometimes the HW questions can be hard to understand what they're asking, but Lair and SL's are extremely helpful. It's accurate to being 5 units.	CS-106A
0	If you have no experience at all like me you are guarenteed a B in this class. If you put in the work and time then you will get an A for sure. USE LAIR!! Overall, good class but for an intro class definitely moves way too fast	CS-106A
0	Its a great class! Its a lot of work but definitely take it! The teaching team is incredible. They make it worthwhile in and of itself.	CS-106A
0	Would 100% recommend for everyone, especially those that have no experience with coding!	CS-106A
0	It's a fantastic introduction to the coding world. As someone who had zero coding experience prior to the course, I was very intimidated at first however I quickly realized the welcoming nature of both the teaching staff and the course content itself.	CS-106A
0	Don't let yourself get behind because the class is very fast paced!	CS-106A
0	Great introduction to programming!	CS-106A
0	Take it for sure regardless of what you are interested in majoring in or studying. The things you learn in this class are very applicable to the real world and it's nice to learn at least a little bit about the fundamentals of programming.	CS-106A
0	Very good class, content and learning environment. Take it!	CS-106A
0	tough course for introductory class, make sure you don't fall behind, attend all lectures	CS-106A
0	This course is super well taught and fun. It's a wonderful introduction to coding. I definitely recommend taking it if you even have a sliver of interest in coding.	CS-106A
0	This class is hard if you don't have a background in programming, but there are a lot of resources available to help you. Make sure you will have time to take advantage of those resources (office hours, LAIR, etc) to get the homework done and do well on exams. Nevertheless, I learned a lot. I won't be continuing to higher div CS classes, but a humanities major interested in data visualization, I'm happy I didn't shy away from the class.	CS-106A
0	I would highly recommend this course. It is probably the most well structured class I have ever taken and each aspect (lecture, lecture note, section, and p-sets) taught me so much.	CS-106A
0	Definitely take out! This class is really well-taught and super interesting. Not having a coding background did not stop me from learning about the concepts in this course.	CS-106A
0	This is, as they say, friendly for students that have not taken any computer science class in the past. So I would recommend this class to any student.	CS-106A
0	This course is tough, but the instruction of nick is fantastic and despite struggling through the course i enjoyed lecture a lot!	CS-106A
0	This course is awesome. The problem sets can be frustrating at times, but as long as you pay attention in class you will have all the tools to complete them. Nick is an extremely intelligent professor and very fun to listen to.	CS-106A
0	A great class, definitely recommend it.	CS-106A
0	I had no idea what programming is about essentially, but after this class, I got really motivated to explore it more. It is pretty accessible, fun, and engaging. Start your homeworks with ample time so you can get help and make sure you understand everything along the way.	CS-106A
0	Very easy intro computer science class. The assignments are fun and the professor is excellent.	CS-106A
0	This is probably the best-taught class I have ever taken and certainly my favorite class at Stanford so far. I had no coding experience coming into the class, but the way the class was taught was so approachable that it made me feel that I was being guided every step of the way.	CS-106A
0	I feel like this class moves too fast to actually be able to retain what you're learning.	CS-106A
0	A great intro class into CS. Stay on top of your homework and try to start it early.	CS-106A
0	TAKE THIS CLASS!! Nick is an amazing instructor and keeps class so interesting. It's genuinely catered to beginners and those who have no experience with coding, and by the end you get a really strong foundation in Python as well as a deeper understanding of how computers work which is useful for practically any field.	CS-106A
0	I think it gives you a really good background about how to approach coding problems. The p-sets can definitely be challenging but with hard work, you should be able to do it!	CS-106A
0	Definitely doable.	CS-106A
0	You don't have to know anything about coding to take this course.	CS-106A
0	They do a great job of explaining the course and the work. However, it is still pretty difficult if you haven't done any coding previously. It's like learning another language. Lair is extremely helpful.	CS-106A
0	To be honest I took the course as a prerequisite to a prerequisite to the course of my interest. But it turned out to be a real gem. The course is matured and well taught. I knew something about Python before however it helped reveal some lacunas in my understanding. Please pay attention to Nick` s remarks and links shared: if he pays attention to something in the past it` s really cool and gives you a perspective of CS evolution in the last few decades. Nick can teach you on outdated soft (Tkinter) if it` s the best available learning path. Be ready  for that strange feeling after the course when reality will dissolve into pixels, packets, decomposition and dicts!	CS-106A
0	Regardless of if you are planning to be a computer science major or not, I would absolutely recommend this course! The teaching staff is extremely open and helpful, the concepts are manageable to grasp, and the assignments are reasonable.	CS-106A
0	Great course! Pay attention to detail during exams, small mistakes can get you docked a lot of points. get started on psets early, there's lots of resources for help but it's less stress the earlier you start. Overall, very fun to learn and empowering, especially if you haven't taken a CS course before.	CS-106A
0	I won't lie and say that this class is easy. But if put in the time and dedication, the material is given to you in a way that allows you to succeed. Read the homeworks carefully. If you've never taken a single coding class before like me, it can be intimidating in the beginning... but hang in there. You'll be doing some really cool stuff by the end.	CS-106A
0	If you have no programming experience, DONT WORRY! This class is the perfect intro - I went from nothing and feel like I'm very proficient in python. Also inspired to take 106B even though it doesn't count for my major.	CS-106A
0	Very good class for intro to CS. Not much else to say here. Honestly, essential to the Stanford Experience regardless of interest!	CS-106A
0	This is a great class that gives you important skills	CS-106A
0	Take it if you have any curiosity pertaining to computer science but limited experience.	CS-106A
0	This course is very accessible to those who have little to no prior experience with coding or programming. Nick Parlante keeps lectures relatively jovial.	CS-106A
0	This class isn't as approachable as many people make it out to be, especially if you don't have a good technical background. If you don't have a technical background at all, I recommend prioritizing this class for the quarter. You should be fine then.	CS-106A
0	Must take. It's worth trying, even if programming isn't in your future plans. Can be very difficult and frustrating but it's a great way to build a new form of thinking and push your abilities of problem-solving. LaIR is incredible and should definitely be used, especially for more challenging assignments. Practice exams and materials (warm-ups) are phenomenal resources, especially for exams. Thus, exams are manageable for sure.	CS-106A
0	CS 106A is an incredibly well-organized course, and everyone at Stanford should take it. The course is quite easy, even for someone with no programming background, since it is so well-organized and there is a wealth of support. For those with programming experience, it won't hurt to take the course, but it definitely will be very straightforward. It doesn't prepare you that well for CS 106B, but provides a good, basic overview of CS. If you take 106A and love it, however, that doesn't mean you'll love all of CS E 106A is meant to draw you into CS with exciting, visually appealing, and relatively easy problem-solving assignments. Overall, highly recommend, and don't be scared of it!	CS-106A
0	I recommend the course if the student is interested in Computer Science. The course is very informative and one will not leave disappointed with the amount of knowledge that is gained from the course.	CS-106A
0	It is somewhat beginner friendly, but still a great class to take. Also time consuming.	CS-106A
0	There's lots of resources to help you if you get stuck in this course. This class is suitable to those with no coding experience. The examples in class are much easier than the homework, but there's lots of support for you as well.	CS-106A
0	I think everyone should take this class because it's a great foundation to CS and Nick is a great lecturer.	CS-106A
0	This class is engaging, but is extremely fast-paced without much individualized support at all. Section leaders do not offer office hours, LaIR is only offered at night and has very long wait times, and the only time to ask questions during class is after lecture.	CS-106A
0	"It's a really fun introduction to programming, but I think sometimes it can be hard to fathom how the programs you are writing can be scaled to the ""real world"" of programming."	CS-106A
0	This is not a beginner friendly course if you tend to learn slowly. The class is fast paced and hard, but if you understand and remember everything, you will learn a lot; still, you will learn a decent amount regardless. The assignments are time consuming, but the slides/notes provided for lecture are detailed and clear to read.	CS-106A
0	This was such a great introduction to computer science! I loved this class and the assignments were all fun.	CS-106A
0	Staff is very nice and understanding. The course does get harder as the quarter starts to wrap up however i think youEll be okay if you stay on top of your work. It can really bite you in the behind if you slack off.	CS-106A
0	If you've had substantial programming experience in the past, you should talk to someone in the CS department about whether or not you should take this class. There's a chance that you should skip this class and go straight to CS 106B. This class is designed for people who don't have any programming experience. I came into this class with ~5 years professional software engineering experience. While I absolutely do not regret taking CS 106A, if you are in a similar situation, you may want to consider skipping ahead to CS 106B.	CS-106A
0	Great overview of the Python programming language. Age-old wisdom, but you get out of it what you put into it. Certainly a course that has a strong, consistent cadence. Quite easy to loose touch with the weekly rhythm and fall behind. Be diligent with keeping up with lectures.	CS-106A
0	I would not recommend this course to beginners in CS. This course is very challenging and should have prerequisites. The class moves very fast and is not easy to keep up with unless you are very on top of the material.	CS-106A
0	I am a humanities person but still find the class to be enjoyable. This is not my first CS class, but some of the concepts still moderately challenged me. Everyone is given enough resources to succeed in the class, which I greatly appreciate.	CS-106A
0	Definitely worth taking to pick up some basic skills--it's very approachable even if you have no coding experience, the homework assignments match the content covered in class pretty well, and Nick is an engaging instructor who goes at a pace that's very easy to follow. Worth it for anyone in any major and probably the only enjoyable large introductory course I have taken at Stanford so far.	CS-106A
0	Take this class. The teaching is incredible and the material is super interesting. I think everyone at Stanford should take CS106A.	CS-106A
0	This class in very interesting! It starts with a simple robotic game and will make you gradually learn and fall in love with programming. If you want to learn some simple but useful coding, I suggest to take this class!	CS-106A
0	Take it for sure even if you have no programming background or even a desire to go into CS. I think it is catered to beginners very well. The professor is excellent and so is the entire teaching team. There are also a lot of helpful resources like LaIR.	CS-106A
0	I highly recommend 106A, it is structured in a way that is easy to understand both for non-CS majors and people who have never programmed before. The professors are very dynamic and great at their job. I think you will enjoy it a lot!	CS-106A
0	If you have no coding experience, you will have to do some additional work. Clear your plate for this course because it takes a lot of your time.	CS-106A
0	This is a great class, and I would highly recommend!	CS-106A
0	Great course. No matter what major you are in, coding and python in general trains your logic and helps you think better.	CS-106A
0	Very good class, taught at a good pace but a lot of work.	CS-106A
0	It's a great course!	CS-106A
0	TAKE THIS CLASS! 106A is an incredible course for anyone, regardless of your major or background (I had zero previous experience coding before 106A). The instruction is fantastic, the programming is fun, and Python is an incredibly useful skill to have. Nick is extremely knowledgeable and makes lectures very fun, and the weekly homework assignments are fairly easy because the concepts are so well-taught. Definitely my favorite class at Stanford so far!	CS-106A
0	I would say that if it's your first time coding, this class is great for beginners but definitely requires extra practice like going over the lessons and working over the experimental server. It's definitely doable, but LaIR is a great resource.	CS-106A
0	Standard intro CS course... dedicate time to it, and it's very doable!	CS-106A
0	For someone who has never taken CS before, I found the class to be somewhat difficult. Be prepared to put in quite a bit of work but the end result is very rewarding.	CS-106A
0	Take this course because it provides an accessible introduction to CS and leaves you with real skills.	CS-106A
0	CS 106a is a great course to take if you're looking for an introduction to programming. The homework takes a while to complete some weeks but if you start early and designate some time to it, you can definitely get it done early. Section can be a bit un-useful at times, but I do appreciate the section leaders' dedications to our learning. The midterms and finals can feel like a bit of a memorization game rather than a test on programming knowledge due to the fact that you don't get to run your code.	CS-106A
0	Take this class! I came in with zero coding experience, but I'm quite confident in my coding ability now and am honestly inspired to take more CS classes in the future. Dr. Parlante is a great instructor.	CS-106A
0	Take this class! As long as you don't get behind on lectures this class is very easy to succeed in, and is super cool to learn about coding.	CS-106A
0	Stay on top of lectures	CS-106A
0	Take it if you want to learn the basics of coding! I think it's very well taught and the teaching team has set up a great system in the form of sections and additional sessions to ensure you get the necessary help	CS-106A
0	I really enjoyed this class and I believe it has definitely prepared me to pursue the next step in my computer science education. I believe I can actually implement some of the things I learned in this class at my place of work. While I am still a CS novice programmer, I couldn't have asked for a more supportive environment to master the fundamentals needed to more up the computer science complexity curve.	CS-106A
0	Find a group to work on psets with!	CS-106A
0	Great class, take it even if you are not interested in CS!	CS-106A
0	Do take it! Prof. Parlante is very good at teaching the class and the slew of TAs are there to help you if you need it. A very good intro to Python and everything was explained from the base level upwards (no prior knowledge required at all, and this is coming from a complete CS noob like me).	CS-106A
0	Excellent course - a must-take for beginners interested in computer science!	CS-106A
0	Nothing	CS-106A
0	Study hard for the final and do good	CS-106A
0	I would take this class even if you have absolutely no idea how to do any form of coding.	CS-106A
0	Must-take for any student.  Coding python is a great skill to know and CS106A is a great, not super hard class.	CS-106A
0	Take it! You might find it super enjoyable. But don't start assignments too late.	CS-106A
0	This is an amazing course that I think every Stanford student has to take - a no brainer for sure, even for humanities focused students who might want a fun class in STEM/CS.	CS-106A
0	The course is extremely well taught, but it starts out a little difficult as you get the hang of programming. As you get more experienced, though, the class and assignments get easier. Truly an introductory course.	CS-106A
0	Great class if you have no experience coding.	CS-106A
0	I really struggled with this class even while attending every lecture and watching the recorded lectures, and I'm not sure how else I could have done better, because LAIR was not very helpful when I went.	CS-106A
0	Definitely take it! Took it with some prior coding experience (did not think I would have felt confident enough to go straight to 106B) and there's still a lot you can learn. I got through just fine by looking at the lecture notes. P-sets are interesting to work on (watch out for Babynames, that's longer) but occasionally instructions may be slightly unclear E just ask for clarification. Overall would 100% take again.	CS-106A
0	Great introduction to python, though the pace of the course is perhaps a little bit slow	CS-106A
0	Everyone should take it.	CS-106A
0	very good intro class, especially if you have no experience in coding. well taught and nick makes it easy to understand	CS-106A
0	Good motivation to begin learning programming--I recommend doing a lot of the learning on your own and use the notes as a resource to complete the homeworks.	CS-106A
0	Incredible class! Very well taught, engaging, homework assignments are manageable and fun!	CS-106A
0	super helpful	CS-106A
0	its a great way to learn a different type of material	CS-106A
0	pray u get a understanding SL tbh but nick is greatttt	CS-106A
0	There is virtually nothing to be said about this class that has not been said before. I went in skeptically suspecting that the class wasn't as good as people hyped it up to be, but all of my expectations were met (and more). I love Nick!	CS-106A
0	Great intro level coding class. Very manageable and tests are always fair/you know what to expect. Nick Parlante is a great lecturer -- very engaging and easy to understand.	CS-106A
0	absolutely	CS-106A
0	The lectures were amazing and the section leaders are extremely helpful. I was not used to the fast-paced nature of the lectures and homework assignments and had a difficult time adjusting because I was taking other heavy classes. Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class.	CS-106A
0	It helped me learn to code, and I recommend it I think if this is down your lane of interest and bandwidth hopefully	CS-106A
0	Really interesting course	CS-106A
0	This class is really well taught and a good intro to computer programming. The assignments are interesting and achievable with what is taught in lecture. As a non-STEM major, I assumed this class would be somewhat inaccessible, but that was not the case at all. The course is designed to be enjoyable for all, even if you have never coded before. That being said, if you have previous coding experience (even if in another programming language) it will make the material much easier, as the main focus is not Python syntax but the logic of programming.	CS-106A
0	"CS106A with Nick Parlante was the perfect freshman year winter quarter experience and honestly the most organized class I have ever taken. After taking this class, I feel like I have a very thorough of understanding of Python, which I know is only the tip of the ""CS iceberg"" yet has encouraged me to sign up for CS106B in the spring and possibly continue on to a CS minor or major in the future! I am so glad I decided to take this class the time I did. It has been a LOT of time and effort on my part, but also it has been such an overwhelmingly positive experience :) I especially recommend going to all IG's offered and attending LAIR often to get your questions answered."	CS-106A
0	Nick Parlante is an engaging instructor; he is excellent at breaking down concepts into bite-sized pieces and explaining them well. A fun CS course for a person with negligible CS experience.	CS-106A
0	A great way to get into programming, improve programming if you're a novice, and learn intro Python.	CS-106A
0	A lot work, but very fun!	CS-106A
0	Take it! I had no background in computer science at all and it was a great intro class.	CS-106A
0	If you are taking CS106A, make sure to attend section and work through each problem using visualizations. It helps to understand how the code works.	CS-106A
0	You go to a top computer science university, might as well take a CS class. You learn the basics of coding, but the psets will take a while.	CS-106A
0	This class is an exercise in cold, logical thinking. It is very well-organized and manageable for the attentive student, but if you have a lot else going on this quarter you may be tempted to try and cut corners, which could lead to frustration or diminish learning. The tests look a lot like homework and practice problems.	CS-106A
0	Take it! ItEs so much fun and gives you a great framework to base and structure thought and future projects.	CS-106A
0	Great class that really starts at the beginning and builds up your skills! You will be surprised by your level of improvement over the course of the quarter. Looking back and reflecting on all you have learned and all the assignments you have completed is rewarding.	CS-106A
0	This is a great introductory course for people who have never coded before. As a person who really liked logic puzzles growing up, I found the assignments kind of fun. Nick is very clear in his explanations. This class if very doable if you put in the work to try to understand exactly what you are doing with your code.	CS-106A
0	As a student who had no background in coding, I really enjoyed taking this class and found it to be very rewarding!	CS-106A
0	take it! super organized and you will learn a lot	CS-106A
0	Honestly, take it. I was not planning to take 106A ever and I felt like I was abandoning myself by enrolling in it, but I enjoyed it a lot and feel quite accomplished after finishing it. Nick is great and if you have a good section leader, even better. Just start the assignments when they're assigned and it shouldn't be too stressful. There's a ton of help available to you on all assignments.	CS-106A
0	Well-organized and well-taught class, and many people take this course for obvious reasons. The amount of hand-holding/practice problems/simulations they provide also shows how much the school cares about the CS program and how so many people switch majors from virtually any major to CS.	CS-106A
0	Absolutely take this class! It is a right of passage; everyone files their teeth on CS 106A. Have no previous programming experience. Nick is an extremely kind and caring instructor. Go to office hours, he wants to help and will work with you to ensure your success in the class. Everyone believes in you. You got this! I am pretty sure, behind closed doors, the lair people are selected for their ability to not only teach but uplift. Lair is an incredible resource where the student instructors radiates positivity. I had too much fun! Made so many friends while learning.	CS-106A
0	The course itself is straightforward if you are aware that it is a time commitment that may sometimes exceed its 5-unit appearance. Otherwise, you might find yourself struggling to get assignments in on time.	CS-106A
0	Highly recommend! Worth the time!	CS-106A
0	Don't hesitate to seek help at Lair and Ed.	CS-106A
0	It's really an awesome course, and CS is so applicable. Definitely recommend	CS-106A
0	have a good time	CS-106A
0	Take it! It is not as easy as many say it is, and the level of difficult varies wildly for each person. For some people, the assignments take a few hours, while for me, many of them took more than twelve hours. I was a complete beginner, but the class is well-structured where you walk away with the skills to know how to code. The assignments can be pretty frustrating, and definitely start early! Do them as soon as they are released because the lecture material is still fresh in your mind.	CS-106A
0	Would highly recommend taking it!	CS-106A
0	If you are interested in improving your skills and bettering your understanding of python, take this course.	CS-106A
0	This is a very well taught class which helps to expand your CS knowledge. While it can be challenging at times, it is very fulfilling and interesting.	CS-106A
0	It's 106a. Super polished. Good intro.	CS-106A
0	Take it! It's a great introduction to Python and by the fourth week, you can do a lot! Paying attention in class and participating in discussion sets you up well. There is a ridiculous amount of resources for this class from Lair to section leaders that care.	CS-106A
0	Watch lecture	CS-106A
0	It's good. Not too difficult and some parts are pretty fun. Would recommend to any Stanford student.	CS-106A
0	Absolutely take it. I was a senior who had barely done any programming, but I like to think that I'm a very logical thinker (e.g. I also like law, debate, and political theory). I thought I wouldn't be a good programmer but was persuaded by my friends to take CS106a before I graduated. I really enjoyed the class, found the instruction very enjoyable and the assignments were all very doable and very interesting. Wish I'd taken it earlier.	CS-106A
0	Awesome class! A must take if you're into puzzles/problem solving, and the weekly problem sets are extremely applicable to everyday life.	CS-106A
0	This class is one of the best classes I have taken so far. It really engages your critical thinking and Professor Parlante is awesome.	CS-106A
0	"@ My fuzzies, you can take this class. It definitely exercises a different part of your brain, specifically your logic and problem solving skills. It really made sense that python is called a ""language"", as you are learning grammar (syntax), and words specific to Python code. This aspect is honestly pretty fuzzy by nature. The teaching within this class feels very polished, like you are the hundredth class to be taught by that professor, and whatever problem you run into, they've seen it before. I spent a looooot of time in LaIR and Black LaIR. There are some days where you will get the assignments right away, and other days where you will curse the day that you signed up to take 106a. There were many nights I had to go to Lair instead of hang out with friends, or miss Friday night events because I was sweating over CS. Try your best to keep up with the material as much as possible/do the hw yourself as much as possible. I admittedly relied on the resources a little too much, and had a lot of catchup to do at the end, which was hard to manage. Overall a good class, but would definitely balance it out with non-PSET classes. You can do it!"	CS-106A
0	I was so intimated by CS (I had never done ANY coding before) but this is a great introductory course! The material is present in a very organized fashion and the tests are very reasonable in this difficulty level.	CS-106A
0	Take it!! I was super nervous for this course because I don't have coding experience, but Nick lectures so well and explains everything in great detail. The class is organized and taught so well, they want you to succeed.	CS-106A
0	Make sure you start your assignment early!	CS-106A
0	- Great instruction!	CS-106A
0	Super fun, light workload.	CS-106A
0	Very interesting class and good introduction to CS	CS-106A
0	Strongly recommend. Great introduction to Python coding and not too repetitive if you have slight experience with coding.	CS-106A
0	Amazing intro to CS course.	CS-106A
0	really great course even for students who have had some previous experience in programming	CS-106A
0	Genuinely thought this class was amazing. Nick was a great lecturer and was very entertaining. Juliette was a wonderful head TA. Lectures were the perfect pace (never left feeling confused, but it wasn't boring). The course was well organized with plenty of practice problems and the homework assignments felt meaningful (I enjoyed all of them and it didn't feel like work). Prior to this class, I had never coded, but now I'm planning on taking more CS.	CS-106A
0	CS 106A is a very well-oiled machine.; can't go wrong with it. I had no prior programming experience, but I greatly enjoyed it, 10/10 would recommend	CS-106A
0	CS106A is very fun! Nick is a great instructor and the teaching staff is very supportive. The sections do go a little too slow, but it is always good to review the material slowly	CS-106A
0	Nick Parlante is very good. Funny, enjoyable, and a good teacher. Bar the fact that lectures are insanely fast. Nick Parlante interacts with a massive lecture hall worth of students and brings the energy to back it up! No Nick Parlante slander as we like to say.	CS-106A
0	MUST TAKE	CS-106A
0	Good intro class to take, moves fast so stay on top of your work	CS-106A
0	This course is great for an introduction to coding (Python), and the assignments focus on relevant topics and produce cool results. If you take this class and have never coded before I highly recommend taking a light course load. Coding is especially time consuming. Professor Parlante and TA Woodrow are great! They make lectures engaging and the lectures/notes are comprehensive. Professor Parlante and TA Woodrow are also extremely encouraging.	CS-106A
1	Definitely be prepared to put in the work	CS-106B
1	Yeah this course is hard and a big step-up from 106a. Be prepared to spend 10+ hours on some coding assignments. However, it is doable! There are a lot of resources available to help you throughout the course. LAIR is an awesome resource to help you with debugging. Section is also a great time to get your questions answered and to solidify what you have learned in lecture.	CS-106B
1	Assignments can take a long time so plan accordingly	CS-106B
1	This is a brilliant class and while the assignments are certainly tough, Keith is a wonderful teacher. The only thing I would recommend is when teaching recursive backtracking, teach it using choose / un-choose first rather than using const references. I watched a lecture on YouTube by Julie Zelenski on recursive backtracking and it helped me so much in understand the thought process behind why we use it. It gave an example of the queens on a chess board.	CS-106B
1	"The curriculum of CS 106B, along with the expectations, demands, difficulty, etc, famously vary between instructors. It's well known that Keith's version of CS 106B is considered to be the most difficult, as he spends more time on recursion and asks more out of students, and the exams seem to be harder than in other quarters. But if you intend to continue taking CS classes past CS 106B, consider this before you plan your schedule away from Keith - completing Keith's version will make you far better prepared for later courses such as CS 107 and CS 161, and taking an ""easier"" variant will put you at a distinct disadvantage later on in classes, interviews, and real-world programming. It's a good idea to invest in understanding CS fundamentals as much as possible."	CS-106B
1	It is not meant to be easy especially if you have no prior experience other than 106a, but it is very useful and fun.	CS-106B
1	One of the few courses I can actually say the teaching was excellent. And Keith is a brilliant lecturer, and though his homework is harder than normal, it really helps you to learn	CS-106B
1	It is a step up from CS106A, but there is a lot to take from this course. I would highly recommend having a partner and to use the weekends to start the assignments.	CS-106B
1	Be wary of taking it with Keith if you're not ready to put in a ton of work and set aside the time to do it right. But if you really want to improve your coding skills, this is a great course!	CS-106B
1	Keith is an amazing lecturer and I was continually astounded by the quality of instruction. As I'm sure you've heard, the assignments can be quite rough; in my opinion, though, it's not unmanageable if you plan ahead and manage your time correctly. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in learning basic programming	CS-106B
1	Keith is an excellent lecturer and instructor, but his assignments and overall pace are overwhelming. This was reiterated by many of my peers, especially around the midterm. Luckily, the teaching team seemed to take the feedback from the midterm and made improvements on the final. I would say to take this course with Keith if you are comfortable with a fast-paced lecture style and aren't afraid of challenging and lengthy psets.	CS-106B
1	Good course. The assignments aren't easy, so start early and try to emphasize understanding and clarity of thought. I came into this class with not much CS background but I self-studied up to week 7 of Harvard's online course CS50 on edX, and that was more than enough preparation to take CS 106B as my first CS course at Stanford.	CS-106B
1	Take CS 106B (especially with Keith)! You will learn so much and develop as a programmer and problem solver.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a tough professor, but you will be challenged and as a result learn a lot. Keep up with the lectures and make sure to do practice problems.	CS-106B
1	While Keith is a great instructor, his homework and exams are too difficult to handle. It can be quite overbearing. I wish I could have taken 106b with a different instructor.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a fantastic lecturer -- I found all of the lectures clear and engaging. I definitely feel like my programming skills improved alongside my logical and analytical skills.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a great lecturer who is passionate about what he is teaching. Do the extensions on the assignments.	CS-106B
1	Definitely a big time commitment but if you start the assignments early it's doable. You learn a lot.	CS-106B
1	Do not take this class with Keith. I had an awful time in this class. Easily one of my worst quarters. While in this class myself and my classmates had to visit CAPS regularly to cope with the stress and pressure of the course. Save yourself the suffering and take it with someone else	CS-106B
1	This is a challenging yet excellent course that I would recommend to any student that is interested in improving their intuitions and skills in programming beyond the basics of CS106A. Just be sure to do each assignment piecemeal throughout the week as it is suggested and attend sections in order to clear any confusion on the week's material.	CS-106B
1	This class is very time consuming. Make sure to allocate a lot of time to the problem sets and if the assignment is in partners make sure to get a partner. Keith gives so much work but honestly it'll give you a really strong CS foundation so I don't wanna say don't take it with him, just be aware that you will be selling your soul to CS for the quarter as an investment to being a good coder.	CS-106B
1	excellent course, lots of fun too!	CS-106B
1	It might seem tough and the assignments will take in a lot of work but in the end you will come out a much more confident programmer and problem solver. Trust me, I was one such student too.	CS-106B
1	SO HARD	CS-106B
1	Great class. My only recommendation is not to change the class' rules during the quarter.	CS-106B
1	The amount you learn in 10 weeks is incredible. I came into the class having taken 106A the previous quarter,  and the first few weeks were incredibly tough because the amount of material felt overwhelming and foreign. By the end of the quarter, though, as you're putting together all that you have learned, the results are remarkable. This has been my toughest class this quarter but also my favorite class. If you love a good challenge and want to learn a ton about CS, I recommend you take this course.	CS-106B
1	It's a tough class but it will make you a lot better at CS!	CS-106B
1	Start homework early, and do lots of recursion problems. Always try to understand what you are coding and why you are coding.	CS-106B
1	Much harder than 106A to be honest.I got an A in 106A, and had to put in much effort to get what appears to be a really not that great grade. I think while Keith Schwarz is an exceptional lecturer and a joy to listen to, there's dissonance between where the class thinks we are and where we actually are. The assignments were immensely challenging, by far the most difficult assignments I've ever done in my life, and the midterm exam that was supposed to take 3 hours took almost everyone I knew more (on average I'd say about 15 hours or so was the general consensus). There wasn't any way to police collaboration, since just conceptual help likely wouldn't be noted by the plagiarism detector that's used, and I feel like that definitely shifted the grade distributions (it was slightly more bimodal than it was normal).  A good amount of my friends have had coding experience more extensive to 106A and they still struggled. I wouldn't really recommend taking this class (at least, the version we took) with just 106A as your coding background. I feel like I prepped for the class as much as I could and it still wasn't enough. Hopefully, the class changes its formatting for midterm exams in future iterations.	CS-106B
1	I recommend trying to do as many extensions as possible. The extra practice and additional perspective is very much worth it.	CS-106B
1	This class if difficult with Keith, but very rewarding. Unless you have knowledge beyond 106A, the recursion part will be very challenging and I suggest you go to Lair for all conceptual questions. I would recommend that you go to LAIR not for debugging help thought because it is a crutch that makes the midterm and final much much harder. Neil and Keith are nice about extensions. Just ask a day earlier.	CS-106B
1	Good class. Keith is a good and engaging lecturer, and his assignments really make you understand the concepts you're learning. If you take the class with Keith, you'll learn about many weirdly named, cute animals.	CS-106B
1	Great course, be sure to start work early	CS-106B
1	I really enjoyed it! Keith is a great lecturer and he asks very exciting questions in the homework and tests!	CS-106B
1	It was a great class overall. For partner assignments, make sure to keep in mind when you and your partner are available to meet.	CS-106B
1	This is a fun problem-solving course, definitely harder than 106a but if you enjoy coding definitely take it. Gives a nice foundation of a lot of core coding concepts and there is a great support system.	CS-106B
1	big time commitment, but overall a good class and I learned a lot. Wouldn't recommend taking with a bunch of other hard classes as well though.	CS-106B
1	This class was a lot of work, but you'll look back at the end of the quarter and be amazed at how much you learned.	CS-106B
1	Fantastic, but takes aA LOT of time	CS-106B
1	This class is horrible in the winter when taught by Keith. Lectures are not engaging or useful, sections are designed poorly, assignments are overly difficult, and the finals are set up for students to feel. If you value your mental health at all, or wish for your love of computer science to not be corrupted by such a bad lead instructor, I strongly suggest taking it in the fall or spring.	CS-106B
1	This class is really hard, the assignments are really challenging. Try to find a partner for sure, I didn't do that and that definitely contributed to why I struggled in this class. Recursion is a challenging concept and it can feel really frustrating when you don't get it after hours of thinking. I still don't really understand recursion but I feel like practice helps. Start assignments early and don't procrastinate.	CS-106B
1	It is really fun if you enjoy CS!	CS-106B
1	If you came into CS 106A with some CS background, it'll be a huge jump up for difficulty/time commitment. Keith quarter does indeed have harder homework/exams, and do be prepared to spend a lot of time on the assignments, especially with the assignments with recursion. However, if you plan your time wisely, this is not an impossible course, and you will learn a lot.	CS-106B
1	You'll learn a whole lot (the techniques are harder than adjusting to the syntax).	CS-106B
1	CS106B with Keith is quite challenging but also rewarding. The mid terms, finals and even assignments are harder with Keith but he is a very good instructor and a very nice person as well. If you do not have that many hard classes alongside cs106B, I would Definitely recommend taking it with Keith. You will learn a ton during these 10 weeks. I can definitely say that I 100% enjoyed this class. Possibly convinced me to pursue Cs.	CS-106B
1	I think Keith is such a good lecturer! The assignments are hard but I think it is manageable.	CS-106B
1	I learned a lot but it was also quite time-intensive and difficult.  It's a bit of a trade-off from what I hear.  I'm glad I took the course when I did but I heard that it is significantly easier during the Fall.	CS-106B
1	The psets are unreasonably long. It feels like they think this class is the only class you are taking. The midterm and final need some restructuring. There was a lot of drama this quarter surrounding them.	CS-106B
1	pretty big time commitment but definitely worth doing after 106A to see if you want to major in CS.	CS-106B
1	Definitely a fun class as there's lots to learn here. The joy that comes from completing an assignment alone encourages you to learn even more as you progress through the class. At first, some concepts may seem difficult to grasp, but the professors do a great job in making the material digestable.	CS-106B
1	This class isn't for the faint of heart. Keith is a really strong lecturer and makes concepts incredibly digestible! However, his assignments can/are time-consuming, especially toward the middle of the quarter. Do not take this class with another PSET heavy class. It can and will be demanding, and at times, exhausting, but be prepared to learn a lot of concepts in 10 weeks and see how much better of a programmer you will be.	CS-106B
1	Do it!	CS-106B
1	Take it!	CS-106B
1	Start the weekly assignments early and use your resources wisely.	CS-106B
1	This is a great course for anyone who is interested in computer science or wants to see what computer science is like.	CS-106B
1	I think it's a lot harder with Keith, but I also feel so much more confident in my ability to code. I heard from a lot of my peers (who took 106b with other instructors) that they didn't understand recursion, but I feel super solid on it. The PSETs are definitely really time consuming though. Wouldn't recommend taking it in a heavy quarter.	CS-106B
1	I would say it is worth the grind! Keith's lectures are super entertaining, and I very much struggled, but it definitely built character.	CS-106B
1	CS 106B is a challenging and very rewarding course that is run like a well-oiled machine. Keith is enthusiastic and brings lots of energy to each lecture (even on Zoom!), and this class will truly sharpen your programming and problem-solving skills.	CS-106B
1	This class is going to be tough, but there are so many resources to help you do well. The section leaders and Neel are great, and the content is really interesting. There were times where I struggled, but overall I really enjoyed it.	CS-106B
1	This is a fantastic class- so well organized and taught. It is a lot of work though	CS-106B
1	Strongly suggest it for any STEM major	CS-106B
1	If you found CS 106A easy, as I did, don't assume this course will be too (though certainly some of my peers did not struggle as much as I did). Stay on top of it from the very start. It's hard since then lolzies. START ASSIGNMENTS EARLY. Go to LaIR. Although it's good to struggle yourself for a little bit, don't waste hours and hours when you could be learning more intelligently.	CS-106B
1	Taking this class in the winter is a big step up from 106A. Some of the assignments are very difficult, especially the recursion ones.	CS-106B
1	It is a big time investment but there are resources there to help alleviate some of the weight	CS-106B
1	It's time consuming and difficult but definitely worthwhile. Kieth is the best!	CS-106B
1	You just have to be aware that this class isn't to dabble in coding or see if you like it. This is a full-fledged, complex computer science class that you have to spend time understanding and learning to love or at least like.	CS-106B
1	Great class if you put the work in	CS-106B
1	This class will make you want to major in CS.	CS-106B
1	keith is an amazing lecturer, and his psets and exams are hard. highly recommend having programming experience before taking this class.	CS-106B
1	Sections and office hours as well as LAIR are highly highly recommended to do well in this class.	CS-106B
1	It's definetely a worthy course for all the engineering students. I'm not CS major, but I feel more confident about my engineering skillset after taking this course.	CS-106B
1	It's a difficult course but it's definitely rewarding	CS-106B
1	Definitely take this class!! I took this class with Keith and it really whipped me into shape for coding. I had a lot of sleepless nights because the assignments are super hard but I know that I learned a lot.	CS-106B
1	This class was so hard but worth it. I learned a lot and I'm grateful for what I learned.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a good professor and you will learn a TON! The HW is really tricky and difficult, but if you have the time, you will truly learn the concepts properly with Keith. However, be careful. 100% have a partner or you will regret it. Also, I would recommend it taking it with Keith ONLY if that's your only difficult class. Do NOT take it with Math51, Physics or any other difficult classes, it will be bad for both your mental health and grades.	CS-106B
1	Overall this class is challenging. There were definitely times during the quarter when I felt completely dejected/hopeless. However, after looking back at where I came from the growth is tremendous.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a really great lecturer but his assignments take a LOT of time so be prepared.	CS-106B
1	Concepts are not the difficult to grasp and the course is well taught, but its a lot of work. It will consume so many hours of your week that you better have a lot to give up.	CS-106B
1	If you want a quarter where CS is what you eat, breath, and sleep, take it with Keith Shwarz. Keith is a great lecturer and really nice. However, the assignments are extremely hard and the exams are even worse. They say the midterm and final are 3 hour exams but the midterm easily took over 12 hours. The Final was limited to 6 hours and because of that, it is almost impossible to complete without any bugs in that allotted time. I took 106B before with Chris Gregg and that was a much more manageable work load for 106B so I recommend there if you aren't trying to push yourself to the limit. I would say if you are taking CS107 or 107E, take it with Keith to prepare for more rigorous CS courses.	CS-106B
1	This course is really excellent, and Keith will make sure you have the most holistic understanding of the topics at hand. At the same time,assignment take up a lot of brainpower and can take many hours, so make sure that you have enough time to dedicate to this course weekly.	CS-106B
1	it can be tough if work is not started on time but you learn a lot and c++ is nice.	CS-106B
1	This class is really challenging and covers a lot of materials, with a number of main topics being quite difficult to grasp. If you started coding in 106A and enjoyed it then, there is a chance that 106B might dissuade you from pursuing CS further. That said, this is still a course with great instruction quality. Keith is a great teacher who makes challenging material enjoyable, and he has the best sense of humor.	CS-106B
1	It's hard but worth it. If you're going from 106A it will be a little bit of a jump but unavoidable.	CS-106B
1	Make sure to make use of the section classes and material, they are so helpful. Go to lair early and start your assignments early as well!	CS-106B
1	This course is amazing in that you learn so much about application of code, however with Keith, the class simply felt a bit too much. While I would understand the lectures in entirety, the assignments and midterm made me feel unconfident most times about my abilities, and really pushed me both mentally and physically to accomplish the algorithms that we had to solve. While the ideas themselves are not that difficult, it was the tiny bugs and bells-and-whistles that assignments are picky about that made me spend HOURS trying to get help on little errors and simple syntax things that I simply never knew.	CS-106B
1	Great course. Keith is a fantastic lecturer and you will learn a ton. Definitely recommend if you found 106A interesting and/or have a passing interest in CS.	CS-106B
1	One of my favorite courses at Stanford, would definitely recommend	CS-106B
1	Solid course, Keith is great!	CS-106B
1	Keith is a very passionate and caring instructor.  106B is a wonderful class you feel like you learn a ton every session. Couldn't recommend more!	CS-106B
1	A big step up from 106A, but if you're prepared for this you'll enjoy the class and get a lot out of it - you cover so much material in 10 weeks, but make sure you don't get disheartened by the difficulty of assignments on recursion and exams compared to 106A	CS-106B
1	I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that wants to strengthen their aptitude in CS - especially because topics concerning recursion, arrays, and hashing are critical concepts that are imperative to any person interested in CS.	CS-106B
1	A wonderful intro course to computer science and you will learn a lot about programming from this course.	CS-106B
1	.	CS-106B
1	This course is the best course I've taken so far at Stanford.	CS-106B
1	You got this! Everything is doable if you dedicate enough time to it	CS-106B
1	"Sure, the part of the quarter with two weeks of recursion homeworks + the midterm is tough, but that's where the workload of this class peaks! The homeworks only get easier after that. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone. However, they did a bad job of explaining some very basic things, such as the fact that were not learning ""real"" C++. The class uses the Stanford Library documentation, which gives you extra functionalities that C++ doesn't have. This class is more about teaching you how to code and how to think about coding problems, than about actually learning the C++ coding language."	CS-106B
1	It's REALLY a time commitment, if you're serious about doing it yourself and really learning. However, looking back, I feel like this was a good experience and I really learned a lot.	CS-106B
1	Don't take this course with Keith in the winter unless you are absolutely sure you want to do CS. This course is a ton of work and can be discouraging for someone just looking to pick up coding skills. You learn a lot more than you would in another quarter, but in my opinion it's not worth the time you have to put in unless you are sure you enjoy coding already. Save yourself the stress.	CS-106B
1	so difficult. but worth it? get a good pset partner and friends and you will be fine	CS-106B
1	People often like to claim that Keith is absurdly difficult. I don't think so. I don't have a huge amount of prior CS experience, but I will say that just a small amount of effort a day goes a very long way in success.	CS-106B
1	It is a hard course, and will challenge you a lot at times. It is also a huge step up from CS106B. But at the end it is also extremely fun, and very rewarding.	CS-106B
1	Be prepared to put in the work, don't take too many strenuous classes with this one	CS-106B
1	"If you take this course while Kieth is the lecturer, be prepared to put in a lot of effort into this class and for it to be ""the class"" of that quarter. It is a fun class with very challenging homework and exams; however, if you stay on top of lectures, homework (e.g. turning them in on time, working on them through out the week), and practicing what you learn, this can be an amazing class to have. You learn a lot, and your section leader and staff will do their best to make sure that you understand everything you need to, and if you can't, they will point you to someone else who can. It is a hard class, but I am glad that I decided to take it, and I now feel very confident in applying my thinking to future coding endeavors."	CS-106B
1	This is a tough course. I underestimated it and assumed that because I took 106A a year and a half before that it would be smooth sailing. If you are feeling challenged in the early weeks of the quarter - make a plan to get help early! Partner with people who value collaboration. I lacked confidence in my coding abilities and that was perhaps the most detrimental part of the course for me -- because it meant that I struggled with things on the take home exams that I probably could've figured out with some minor changes to my learning.	CS-106B
1	Keith's assignments are really well-designed, but they are difficult. Stay on top of this class.	CS-106B
1	This course was a great introduction to another coding language and taught me a new approach to use to solve problems. My ability to understand problems, devise a plan to solve a problem, then implement a solution using the tools I was provided with greatly improved. My section leader provided me with a lot of support and I found all of the lectures engaging. Although I found that help was easily accessible, the homework assignments were still extremely challenging to me despite my previous programming experience.	CS-106B
1	I can't recommend this class highly enough. Keith is such a wonderful and knowledgeable instructor, and he is really approachable in OHs and lectures, too. The course is extremely well organized and taught, and you will learn a great deal. I was debating if I should take this class at the beginning of the quarter, but I'm so glad that I decided to give it a try. Looking back, I never had a steeper learning curve and this whole experience has been incredibly rewarding, especially for someone who was always scared of coding. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours, but it's all so worth it. I want to mention that I took CS106A in the previous quarter, and in my opinion the concepts and assignments in 106B are much harder and take much more effort and time to fully grasp.	CS-106B
1	This course was extremely difficult, but if you have the time in your schedule to commit yourself to this class, it is useful. This class moves quickly and the assignments take up a lot of time. Keith is a great instructor, however I would recommend taking this class with a different instructor if you are not able to commit extra time to this class because Keith's version is a little different. Also, he gives an estimate of how much time it will take you to complete a test, and that estimate is very low. This class helped me decide that I no longer want to take CS classes.	CS-106B
1	If you want to try CS, take this course as the standard to find out whether you fit this major	CS-106B
1	LaIR is your most valuable resource.	CS-106B
1	CS 106B in the winter is definitely more challenging than it is in the fall or spring, but it is entirely worth it. I do not believe that I would be able to understand the concepts this class teaches as well if I had taken it in a different quarter. The lecturer and TA's are amazing, and are there to help and listen to you. Definitely would recommend 10/10.	CS-106B
1	Maybe upload slides concurrent to the code so students dont have to download new codeEElecture slides structured the 106a style would also be very helpful especially for earlier lectures on knowledge-based fundamentals like data containers	CS-106B
1	Be prepared for a challenge. The class can be fun but remember to budget time for it in your schedule.	CS-106B
1	This class is really interesting, especially when it comes to the topics later in the quarter. Recursion in the middle of the quarter (especially recursive backtracking) is difficult to wrap your head around and the assignments are really a step up from CS 106A. Keith's lectures were really choreographed and organized, but the midterm was extremely rough. Great class overall, just not sure if it is best to take it Winter quarter.	CS-106B
1	If you have any interest in computer science whatsoever then this class is a must. So many fundamental topics taught so well. Keith is enthusiastic and incredibly effective as a lecturer. His team of section leaders and CAs put in the extra mile to make this class an awesome experience.	CS-106B
1	A step up from 106b, but not terrible if you are smart with when you start the PSETs.	CS-106B
1	Recursion is really hard, make sure to start assignments early and go to LAIR. Sections earlier in the week are better as you can apply things to the homework. Midterm is very challenging and make sure not to break honor code as many individuals were caught cheating, its not worth it.	CS-106B
1	It is tough but worth it! Make sure you set aside enough time to work on projects!	CS-106B
1	This is a very well-taught class. It can be challenging at times, but again, it is very well-taught. Lectures are recorded and are great resources to use for revision or additional help when working on assignments. There is always a clear link between problems in class and on assignments and exams. Section is super-helpful if you get a great SL. Overall, would definitely reccommend.	CS-106B
1	ton of work but you learn a lot	CS-106B
1	Really great course where you'll come out feeling like you've learned a lot, regardless of if you plan to be a CS major. Lots of time though so be prepared for that	CS-106B
1	Wonderful class that will challenge you but leave you a better quarter. Thankfully there are many resources (e.g. lair) to help you if you are struggling.	CS-106B
1	"Just because ""everyone takes it"" doesn't mean it's easy, I made that mistake when planning my quarter and regretted it. Use lair, because if you're like me and learn by doing, then if you never actually do it right, you won't learn it right and so it's helpful to have someone to check with. A serious step up from 106a, especially with Keith, but the highs on the roller coaster probably about balanced the lows. Maybe not quite."	CS-106B
1	It's a very challenging class - the lectures are fun and engaging, but the PSETs will take up a huge load of your time. Probably best to take it in a lighter quarter.	CS-106B
1	Love this class. Cannot recommend enough.	CS-106B
1	Good and important primer to CS fundamentals, take note that the workload can be pretty intense	CS-106B
1	This course was really challenging with Keith, he's a good lecturer but the assignments are incredibly challenging and the exams are even more difficult. Having a good hw partner is essential to doing well.	CS-106B
1	Don't take it with Keith. He's a great teacher but the class is way too hard with him and the support we are given simply isn't enough to come out of the course slightly scarred lol...especially if you're only previous coding experience is CS106A.	CS-106B
1	This course showed me that CS is not for me. I tried and tried but the content always seemed out of reach. Lecture seemed surface-level compared to the problems we had to solve, and I struggled way more than I was comfortable with.	CS-106B
1	Stay on top of your lectures. Even though they are offered online don't delay watching new lectures.	CS-106B
1	If you are taking it with Keith, it's not going to be easy, but it is doable. If you understand your weaknesses and work on them, and if you ask for help, you will do well.	CS-106B
1	Keith is a very very good lecturer, hands down one of the best humans I've ever met. That being said, this class is hard, Keith doesn't make it easy either. Be prepared to work 20ish hours a week and go to LaIR every week, sometimes even twice. Otherwise, this course really teaches you a lot about recursion and how to think more abstractly when programming.	CS-106B
1	Hard. definitely learned a lot tho.	CS-106B
1	This is a good course. Have fun!	CS-106B
1	It was challenging taking this in the winter, but at the end I feel like I have become a better programmer.	CS-106B
1	It is a difficult but rewarding CS course, the teaching staff is very understanding. Even if you aren't majoring in CS this course might be a good way to help learn some problem solving techniques and gain a new skill that you didn't have beforehand.	CS-106B
1	taking 106b with Keith is a challenge, especially in the first few weeks with recursion, but it is also very rewarding! The lectures are engaging and I really feel like I learned a lot from the course, partly because it was more challenging at times.	CS-106B
1	A challenging, but fun class.	CS-106B
1	Great course that requires a moderate amount of work each week. Take it if you don't feel confident in your coding skills, the course will definitely boost your confidence after you finish it.	CS-106B
1	Take CS106B if you are interested in pursuing CS later on at Stanford. Otherwise, its a really hard course and not worth the effort if you are not interested in a minor or major. Keith is a great lecturer but his assignments and tests are brutal.	CS-106B
1	Make sure to take good notes in lecture and think through the coding strategies that are presented and also when you take on the assignments themselves. Make sure to map out on paper what your logical approach to a particular assignment is, as I think it's a great way of reinforcing what you learned.	CS-106B
1	It's a great class that provides more of a challenge than 106a but contains much more material and hands-on learning!	CS-106B
1	Very cool but time-consuming course.,	CS-106B
1	The class is hard. It's definitely a big step up from CS106A. But it's not impossible. LaIR is really great (when the lines are 100+ long), and it's even better in person. Keith, as an instructor, was able to explain things in a very down-to-earth, understandable way. The assignments are more fulfilling, I'd say, since there's less hand holding and you really get a sense of the real world applicability of your programs. It's just hard. Psets take a while, the assignments are complicated. But even though I may not take another CS class for a while, I'm glad I have this skill.	CS-106B
1	"My advice is to start assignments early (seriously E start the weekend before they are due) and to study early and very, very well for assessments. In fact, while you are completing problem sets, always keep in mind the different ways a certain concept could be assessed on an upcoming timed exam. Another thing about this course: while it is preached that 106B (with Keith or another prof.) and classes like it are not ""eed-out"" courses intended to toss out the students who may not come into the course with as strong a knowledge-base in CS as other students in the class, CS 106B is a challenging experience (don't let anybody tell you otherwise) and functions to some degree as a weed-out class. Find a section leader who you feel comfortable learning from and who you feel will support you throughout the entirety of the course.."	CS-106B
1	A very interesting and engaging course that teaches a lot both in Computer Science and beyond.	CS-106B
1	Do not take this class winter quarter. While Keith is an amazing teacher and lecturer, his assignments are significantly harder and longer. I know multiple students who have had breakdowns over this class, and have not been able to relax on weekends because of these assignments.	CS-106B
1	Keith has no sense of how hard it is for students to learn CS, which is reflected in the difficulty of assignments and exams. That aside, it was impressive and fulfilling to look back on the sheer amount of content we learned once the class was over. The class was just thoroughly unenjoyable in the moment, which was a big problem. Keep on top of classes or else you'll fail.	CS-106B
1	Do not take it with Keith if you aren't ready for a challenging course.  He expects 100% all the time and will push you to your limits	CS-106B
1	Don't take it with Keith. The assignments are horrible and most of my school and work time was dedicated to this. Even though I tried to get help through lair or office hours, it was hard to do so because so many students needed help. This course made me dislike CS completely and made me feel very stupid and unqualified.	CS-106B
1	It's a very difficult course with Keith; however, you do learn a lot.	CS-106B
1	Keith is an amazing lecturer, but watch out for the work load and difficulty of the problems he sets out. The problem with having a genius as a teacher is that they will most likely not know what the average Stanford student feels like taking these concepts.	CS-106B
1	I love Keith he's hilarious and such a clear and knowledge teacher	CS-106B
1	TAKE IT!! It's hard but it's so worth it - and this is coming from someone who bombed their final so trust that I genuinely enjoyed learning.	CS-106B
1	Take it!!!	CS-106B
1	Make sure you have a backup plan in case your debugger fails. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to your section leader and course staff! They're an awesome resource.	CS-106B
1	Tough but rewarding class. If you put in the work, you'll learn some super interesting skills and gain a deeper understanding of computers. Great class!	CS-106B
1	Watch lectures of previous quarters before signing up for the class and make the most of practicing on your own time.	CS-106B
1	It is a lot of work and you need to start early on the assignments and use your time. It is also smart to explore some of the previous semesters online and get a head start in C++ and recursion. Also read the book.	CS-106B
1	Take this class for sure but make sure you have time to dedicate to it. Also take your own notes and make sure you have an assignment partner.	CS-106B
1	The head TA does not respond to emails. Use edstem for any urgency in responses. Otherwise a great course that covers a lot of interesting material.	CS-106B
1	Be ready to put in a lot of work for this class, but hopefully you find it worth it! Definitely trained my thinking and coding skills a whole lot!	CS-106B
1	It is a demanding class but very rewarding if you put the time and effort in. Make sure you start assignments early and don't fall behind on the lectures.	CS-106B
1	Take it with Keith! You will learn a lot!	CS-106B
1	If you are taking this course in the winter, and feel stressed about the length of psets, do not compare yourself to fall and spring cs106b students, because winter psets are lengthier and more time consuming!	CS-106B
1	This class is definitely challenging, especially if you are like me and struggle to wrap your brain around recursion. That being said, the course as a whole is extremely well organized, the staff is knowledgeable, and the help you have access to is considerable. If you have even a bit of interest in computer science, I would at least try taking this class. People say Keith is particularly hard, but I honestly didn't find that to be the case (if anything, he was super funny and nice throughout the class).	CS-106B
1	To any student who is considering taking this course in the future, make sure to form a study group with other kids in the class, and don't be afraid to reach out to the teaching staff for help.	CS-106B
1	Take it! It was a great intro to C++, especially if you took AP CS in high school. I would advise taking on the assignments Sunday night to get a head start and get to Lair before it gets busy.	CS-106B
1	Take this course, learned a lot.	CS-106B
1	Great class	CS-106B
1	From the perspective of someone who's only previous programming experience is AP CSA, I would say that this course is definitely challenging at times. If you feel like you have a good sense of the programming logic though, the course is quite fun.	CS-106B
1	This class is great introuduction to data sets, classes, object, pointers, recursion techniques, big O run times and identifying different techniques for optmizing code.	CS-106B
1	Definitely take it with Keith, you learn really easily in his lectures and assignments are really hard but worth it	CS-106B
1	Make sure to start assignments early! This will be your biggest helper aside from section leaders, office hours, and LaIR.	CS-106B
1	Great class. Not only teaches you how to program, but how to be a more methodical problem solver. Highly recommend to anyone interested.	CS-106B
1	CS 106b with Kieth is so incredibly well taught! I loved the class and I learned so much. I can't recommend it enough.	CS-106B
1	start assignments earlier	CS-106B
1	Keith is the most enthusiastic lecturer I've ever had. This class was really fun and taught you how to code at a much higher level	CS-106B
1	Be excited to learn new things, especially recursion.	CS-106B
1	Take it! I love Keith's lecture. So energetic and so interesting! It is not as difficult as some other people asy. Start the homework early (by early I mean the first day you can get help in Lair) and seek help when you need it in Lair. You will honestly be fine. I only began CS after coming to Stanford and personally loved this course.	CS-106B
1	It's extremely worth taking if you want to start step into the CS world, you will definitely learn a lot after you take it. And be confident to yourselves, I'm with zero coding experience and I never feel left behind as I worried in the beginning of the semester.	CS-106B
1	Take this class. Keith is an amazing instructor!	CS-106B
1	"This class is one of the most well-taught classes I've ever had, not just in Stanford. The materials of this course are extremely well-organized and the instructor Keith, is one of the best teachers I've ever met in terms of teaching the materials and caring for his students. You will learn a great deal from this class. Granted, there may be hard times, especially with recursion and recursive backtracking, but you will come out of this class thinking: ""Wow! I really have become a different programmer and person."""	CS-106B
1	I loved Keith's lectures because he's so passionate and great at explaining concepts. His assignments do take a long time, so follow the timeline they give you as best as you can. When you go to Lair there can be really long wait times (especially at the beginning of the quarter) so bring some other work if you're completely stuck and just waiting.	CS-106B
2	If you are worried about the rigor of 107, or want a deeper understanding of the material, take this class! Andrew Benson is a great TA and is very very good at ensuring you have a good grasp of what's being covered that week (even if you find yourself behind on lecture).	CS-107
2	Highly recommend	CS-107
2	Totally take this class! It is super helpful and a super low time commitment. Andrew is awesome, and he does a great job of explaining concepts. You can tell how hard he works to make this class as helpful as possible.	CS-107
2	SOOOO helpful, literally could not imagine having taken 107 without 107A. Andrew is by far the best TA I've had.	CS-107
2	Take it take it take it!!!! If you are not confident in doing well in CS107, this is the place to go. Extra office hours are more helpful than that of CS107. As a student who struggled in other infamously difficult classes, this is a life-saver. Take it with Andrew Benson if possible; he's so good at teaching and such a good person.	CS-107
2	Andrew is an amazing person and instructor. He is very kind, accessible, and make my experience of taking 107 much better!	CS-107
2	Andrew is perfect and so helpful	CS-107
2	Best ACE section ever. Take it!	CS-107
2	It is a must take if you are taking 107 E you will understand all the content so much better	CS-107
2	Definitely take it! Andrew is great and the class meetings are helpful for understanding the materials. The most you could get out of this course is to take advantage of the CA and class meetings and ask questions about 107 in a smaller setting. very helpful	CS-107
2	Take it. It is almost a necessary companion to CS107. The extra office hours alone make it worth it	CS-107
2	Take it! go to labs its super helpful for later codings	CS-107
2	Best class at Stanford so far (from a sophomore). It is tough but such a rewarding experience and the teaching team is amazing and supportive!	CS-107
2	This is a great class and I would highly recommend it, especially with Julie and Pat! It's a decent amount of work, but as long as you don't fall behind, its very manageable and there are a lot of resources to help you.	CS-107
2	Pat, Julie and the course staff are amazing. Intense class but incredibly rewarding.	CS-107
2	If you want to feel confident about how a computer works and how to use all manner of sensors and hardware, this is the course for you. Make sure you plan on allotting quite a bit of time for this course! It will be the main event of your term.	CS-107
2	Respect the class with time and you will do fine.	CS-107
2	This class is quite hard and time-consuming, but also incredibly rewarding. If you are open to challenging yourself for the sake of your learning and growth, I highly encourage the course. The content is difficult but the TAs and instructions are all incredibly dedicated to making sure all students succeed.	CS-107
2	I would not recommend taking this course in a heavy quarter. Be prepared to spend time exceeding 5 units of work for this class.	CS-107
2	Please take the class with a friend. it can be very isolating sometime if you don't know anyone in the course.	CS-107
2	This class is a lot of work, will test your self confidence, and might make you feel like you're the only one behind. But Julie and Pat are the best instructors, the TAs are super supportive, and the final project is so fun and satisfying so ultimately this class is worth it!	CS-107
2	I definitely did not know how much work it was going to be. I wish someone had told me or that the staff had been more up front about it in the beginning. Personally, I loved the class, but given that many of my friends are graduating this spring and this was my last quarter with them (I'm studying abroad in the spring), it ate into social time that I will never get back. I would not have taken this class this quarter if there was more upfront warnings about the load.	CS-107
2	This course is super fun and will give you a great community of people, but understand that part of that community is formed through shared struggle. The instructors Pat and Julie are absolutely amazing and so are the TA's but the fact is that this is just a really hard course. Plan on this course taking up the majority of your time debugging, and trying to understand the lectures and things. GO TO OFFICE HOURS and do not, I repeat, DO NOT take this class with a bunch of other time consuming classes (taking CS107E, PWR and a high level math for only 14 units may seem like a good idea but you will soon regret it).	CS-107
2	TAKE IT! I am not super into EE, but I had so much fun. Pat and Julie are AWESOME!!!! Super grateful I took this class.	CS-107
2	This class is incredible. Julie and Pat are absolutely incredible professors. I learned more from this class than any other class I've taken at Stanford. As someone who normally struggles a lot more than the average Stanford student in difficult classes, I found that the content was accessible as long as I had the time to work for it, especially given that Pat and Julie care more about learning than about strict deadlines. It does take a LOT of time, though, so be prepared. There were a couple of weeks where it completely took over my life, and it felt like I had time for almost nothing else. In the end, especially after showing off my skills in the final project, I felt very rewarded, but do ensure that you take into account the workload you will be taking on.	CS-107
2	This course is a great learning experience and I highly recommend it, especially if you don't have any experience with computer hardware or systems. One thing to note is that it can be quite intensive during the middle part of the quarter, so make sure to plan accordingly. The assignments are very interesting and by the end you'll have a complete suite of functionality that you can take pride in having made yourself.	CS-107
2	This class is incredible. The hardest class I took at Stanford, but also my favorite. It has been such an honor to have Pat and Julie as my professors. They are some of the most dedicated, caring professors I have ever had. Our class became such an incredible community. 107E honestly was my life this quarter, and while at times it was stressful, it was so rewarding and I wouldn't have it any other way. With this class, I would focus more on the learning than the grade. I don't think I will end up with a high grade in this class E I had a really hard time finishing the assignments E but I know that even so, I have so much to be proud of with all that I learned.	CS-107
2	This course can be very tough if you are not comfortable with pointers, C, or computer logic/arithmetic. If you are familiar with these concepts, the core assignments are not that difficult but some of the extensions can take time and effort (which you will need if you want an A). The teaching is generally solid and the staff was very helpful in responding to issues or providing general help. The final project can be really daunting, even for someone who did not have any real trouble with the assignments, but the course overall is quite enjoyable and interesting and I would recommend it over 107.	CS-107
2	Definitely take this class. It's an intense learning opportunity with very invested instructors/staff. You will get out as much as you put in.	CS-107
2	Enjoyable class, but not as much hardware experience as you might think it isEstill much more fun than 107!	CS-107
2	This class is incredible!! ItEs challenging but so rewarding. ItEs one of the most engaging cs classes- everything assignment you do has a clear purpose and tangible results. It can be but its so fulfilling, and Pat and Julie are phenomenal lecturers. The tas are amazing and so available to help. Take it, you wonEt regret it.	CS-107
2	This was a fantastic course. Pat and Julie cared about us not just in terms of our learning, but as people, and the community built through this course was absolutely awesome. The support that was given to students went above and beyond my expectations -- Julie even came in from 10pm to past midnight the night before project demos to bring snacks and help us fix bugs. My only regret was I wish I had taken a less difficult courseload outside of this. I was able to get the assignments done, but I wish I could have spent more time in the lab room/doing the extensions on the assignments/getting to know people in the class, working together on homework, etc. -- in scrambling to get things done last minute and not being able to spend more time engaging with the course staff, my peers, and the material, I feel like I didn't get as much out of the class as I could have. So take people seriously when they say that you should allocate more than 5 units to this class.We started the quarter with 3 weeks of online instruction, followed by in person. Julie and Pat handled online teaching extremely well - lectures were great, and I didn't really have any complaints. Online lab was NOT ideal, but they rectified that as soon as it was allowed by Stanford policy.	CS-107
2	Amazing class, it's a lot of work but you end building a computer from the ground up so it's SUPER COOL	CS-107
2	This class is a lot of work, but, if you're interested in diving deep into computer system architecture, this class is the right one for you. This class was legitimately the best class I have ever taken and I am so glad I took it.	CS-107
2	Amazing course! Take it!	CS-107
2	This class is fun but time consuming. If you like go learn from fundamental or meet cool people, go for it	CS-107
2	"This is hands down the most engaging and challenging course I've taken at Stanford so far. Julie, Pat, and the TAs are wonderful, committed, and passionate about what they teach. I never considered myself a ""maker"" or hardware person, but after 107e, I feel like I could truly appreciate the hardware and unseen work that goes into creating the modern computers we get to have access to. It even convinced me to consider a Systems concentration! Be prepared for a significant workload, especially during Week 5-7-ish and Week 9-10. I wouldn't recommend taking much more on top of 107e to get the most out of the course. From what I've heard from 107 students, 107e is slightly harder but definitely manageable if you invest time into really understanding the concepts."	CS-107
2	TAKE IT. PERIOD. It might be useful to know that the amount of work peaks at assignment 3 (week 4) and 4 (week 5) and goes a bit lighter from there. But those two can be quite a bit of grind. Definitely take with a friend (or you can make friends in the class). I love how close the class gets at the end of the quarter. I really appreciate that such an amazing course is offered at Stanford. SHOUT OUT TO THE CS107E TEAM. THEY ARE AMAZING!	CS-107
2	Best class at Stanford so far (from a sophomore). It is tough but such a rewarding experience and the teaching team is amazing and supportive!	CS-107

2	Take this class, but if you aren't a top tier hacker, make it your only difficult class. I took it with CS109, an intro-sem, and a PE class, and I definitely struggled to balance my time between classes. This class was my favorite class, but my grade in CS109 definitely suffered due to my inability to walk away from my CS107E projects and equally distribute my attention. You will not want to stop working on these assignments. They are challenging but soo satisfying.	CS-107
2	I learned so much from this class and feel much more confident in my ability to write clean, functional and modular code. Lecture is super entertaining. Pat and Julie make lecture just the absolute best!! Aside from learning about memory, peripherals and program execution from the ground up you also get exposed to and have to learn how to use many new tools such as git, vim, GDB and the command line. Its a steep learning curve for sure and the third and fourth assignment are definitely quite challenging and tedious, however, you walk away form this class having learned so much and feeling really proud and satisfied that you actually built a computer form the ground up. If you have time you should definitely take this class!!!	CS-107

2	Take the course! It can be heavy at times, but staying on top of the work makes it manageable. Chris Gregg is also an amazing lecturer.	CS-107
2	It's hard but rewarding. Although I am not a system person, the problems we tackle are interesting.	CS-107
2	You have to be meticulous about heap allocator (specifically, explicit allocator). Go into it expecting it to take a long time so you'll be less prone to rush through any code or take any shortcuts. You have to build it extremely incrementally, testing thoroughly at every phase, checking that every aspect of your understanding is perfect. It will not be fun otherwise. Rest of the course isn't too challenging.	CS-107
2	"Not the ""weedout"" class everyone would like you to believe. In fact, the depth over breadth that's provided in this course vs 106b is very fulfilling and leaves you with a relatively deep understanding of how bits and bytes are built into systems."	CS-107
2	go to lecture in person, they really help! psets do take a long time (esp the first one and the last two) and a lot of debugging but start early and go to OH and you'll do fine. I did think the concepts itself (low-level computing, compilers) were very interesting and not that complicated but the debugging and the C language is what makes this course challenging. Also, I thought Chris was great! He is extremely accommodating and easy to approach, and a great prof overall :)	CS-107
2	A lot of material is covered in the course. Make sure to start assignments early. Chris Gregg is a great lecturer but even with understanding of the general concepts, if you've never coded in C before it may take the first couple of assignments to get used to it.	CS-107
2	Put in the time and youEll be rewarded for your efforts	CS-107
2	This class is a lot of work, but in a good way. Professor Chris Gregg did a great job of setting up labs and lecturers that aided the assignments. Of course, there is a lot of frustration that comes with solving bugs, especially on the last assignment of the quarter but starting early allowed me to overcome all this.	CS-107
2	The edstem forum was extremely useful! I definitely saved a lot of time doing the assignments by skimming the edstem forum first to see if there were any tips/questions I should keep in mind before completing the assignments.	CS-107
2	If you aren't ready for enormous amount of stress, don't take it!	CS-107
2	be ready for a big challenge and make sure that you allocate your time well over the course of the quarter to learning the concepts	CS-107
2	Learn linux ASAP, install ubuntu on your machine and just get used to the environment, especially shell commands.	CS-107
2	I would definitely recommend it because it is fun and helps develop fundamentals	CS-107
2	Not as bad as they say. The course staff is super supportive and the assignments become reasonable in terms of workload when you start them early.	CS-107
2	Well-taught, and very fun, at least for me. I find it very satisfying to have a program that runs correctly after poring over it in the debugger for hours, which you will end up doing as well.	CS-107
2	It's a hard course but worth it	CS-107
2	Start every assignment early	CS-107
2	"If you're considering CS, take it! It will make you comfortable with all the basics of computers and coding ""under the hood"". You'll learn C, about using the terminal, handling memory, reading assembly code,... You won't regret it!"	CS-107
2	This class is very fun and informative, but be prepared to have spent a LOT of time on the last two assignments. Both of those assignments ate up more than 2x the amount of time it took me to do each of the other assignments.	CS-107
2	You may struggle but it will be worth it!! I genuinely enjoyed the class and feel much stronger as a programmer. The class is manageable if you start the assignments early and spread out the work as much as possible. The notorious heap allocator assignment deserves its reputation, so have fun!	CS-107
2	The class is challenging but rewarding! Secure vault and heap allocator take a lot of time to complete, but they are very doable so don't be scared.	CS-107
2	This course is amazing. I am not a systems person, and I loved it. I know a lot of people go into this feeling like it is a prerequisite they have to knock out and that it will be painful no matter what. In my experience, the thing people complain about most is the hours and hours of debugging. My biggest advice on this front is to pay attention in lab when they teach you debugging tools. It seriously pays off, but most people don't pay attention since it isn't required. I promise it will save you hours. Having spoken with people who faced similar bugs as me after the assignments were done, the things that took them hours could have been really easily solved with conditional breakpoints, breakpoints with commands, watchpoints, etc. If you take the time to learn how to implement those things in the class debugging program (gdb) then you will have a much better time in this course!	CS-107
2	Tough but rewarding. Take CS 107A with it if possible	CS-107
2	Very time consuming but I think the content is easier than 106B. Office hours fill up fassssst so be sure to use edstem to post questions	CS-107
2	Definitely take this class!! It completes your understanding of programming after the 106 series and is taught very well, with lots of learning resources.	CS-107
2	Take it! Go to office hours	CS-107
2	The course is intense, and assignments become more difficult as the course progresses, with the last two specially time consuming (30-40 hours). Even though it was challenging, this is a great course, it is very well organized, and it is extremely satisfying to successfully complete the assignments. Chris Gregg is a great instructor and deeply cares about you; perhaps the best part is his availability to meet with students and support you wherever he can.	CS-107
2	Take it! Your programming will really improve even though it is time consuming.	CS-107
2	"You'll learn a lot by doing the assignments, but it is a HEAVY and challenging course. Especially for the last two assignments (Binary Bomb and Heap Allocator, Heap Allocator took me 42 hours total in week 10). Start the assignments very early and work a little each day. These are not ""due date, do date"" projects. Glad I got through it all, since I did learn a lot in the end."	CS-107
2	As long as you start the assignments early, theyEre very reasonable and not that stressful. If you took 106B with Keith, this class will be a walk in the park.	CS-107
2	As a non-CS student, this class was difficult, but do-able. At no point did I feel that I was out of my depthEthis is down to the teaching staff. I would certainly recommend this course for those non-CS students who want a more solid understanding of what the computer is doing at the memory level.	CS-107
2	Definitely plan for Assignments 5 and 6 -- they're very tough!	CS-107
2	Let me preface this by saying: CS 107 is my favorite CS class I've taken at Stanford. CS 107 is NOT the terrifying beast that many students make it out to be; in fact, although the assignments are difficult and taxing, they are also incredibly rewarding, and I feel as though I've come out of this class having a significantly better understanding of coding methodology and computer systems (like, I actually know what pointers are now). I thought that the material was really interesting, and if you start assignments relatively early and spend a bit of time reviewing lecture slides, this class will be way more enjoyable for you.	CS-107
2	start the psets asap and just make sure you give each of them more than enough time	CS-107
2	Would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in how software works at a low level. Material is difficult but much less busy work than 106B; just make sure to start the last 2 assignments as early as possible.	CS-107
2	Definitely a lot of work especially towards the end of the quarter with the final two assignments (around 40 hours over ~1-2 weeks each), so make sure you don't overload on credits if you plan on taking this class. Chris is an amazing instructor who teaches with compassion and genuinely cares about the well-being of his students. He definitely makes the class less brutal to take.	CS-107
2	This course is hard and a lot of work, but you also learn a ton. Instructors are very nice and understanding. You become a better programmer after finishing this course.	CS-107
2	This class is known for being challenging. Go into this class understanding and embracing that fact and the course experience is significantly better. The teachers and course staff are beyond helpful with questions and will make sure that every student understands the material before moving on.	CS-107
2	good course. get nick instead of chregg	CS-107
2	The assignments are very long and tedious, but the material is pretty interesting.	CS-107
2	Start assignments early, especially the last two assignments because they are much longer.	CS-107
2	Great course! You'll learn a lot. Make sure to stay on top of lecture material, otherwise assignments will be difficult.	CS-107
2	This is an extremely challenging but rewarding course. I learned so much and it is manageable!	CS-107
2	Make you don't fall behind in the last 3 weeks of the class. Also, make sure you have a solid grasp of assembly code going into the final!!	CS-107
2	nothing	CS-107
2	Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the assignments... sometimes they seem simple and creep up on you.	CS-107
2	Extremely interesting course that discusses the mechanisms and principles behind computer languages with a little bit heavy workload. Definitely take it if you want to further your programming skills.	CS-107
2	I think this course teaches the content it aims to teach very well. I'm not sure how applicable it is to the rest of CS but the class taught me a great deal and the assignments and labs are all well designed.	CS-107
2	A very difficult course, but very rewarding. Chris Gregg is incredibly thorough and helpful with the material, but sticks by his principles and doesn't just spoonfeed answers	CS-107
2	The class is both challenging and super fun. The lectures are amazingly useful, and the labs and assignments are extremely helpful. All the teaching staff is super supportive. So absolutely take it!	CS-107
2	This class almost broke me. It's absurd that this is allowed. Absolute weed-out class so be prepared to have every ounce of you tested. People aren't lying when they say it's hard. Do not take other hard classes during the same quarter unless it's winter and you want to be sad. Very hard, decent instruction, absurd expectations. Head TA literally said Heap Allocator takes ~40 hours and he wasn't lying. Immoral class.	CS-107
2	This course is definitely one I would recommend for people interested in computer science. It is important to know that it is a huge time commitment and it is a little bit arbitrary how long it will take you to complete each given assignment because the debugging process can take anywhere from a couple hours to a couple days. Overall, it is a super interesting class that you can learn a lot from.	CS-107
2	its tough but doable if u put in the time, take an easy load	CS-107
2	Well, I guess if you are taking it, then you are probably CS, so there isn't a choice here. Chris Gregg is pretty dope so consider taking it with him.	CS-107
2	You will learn so much but its a lot of time	CS-107
2	This course is hard! But valuable.	CS-107
2	Start the assignments early, take notes on lectures, and you will have a good time	CS-107
2	Chris Gregg is an enthusiastic lecturer. The assignments can take an unreasonable amount of time, much more than they are worth, if you run into a terrible bug, so be prepared for that. Many students would have enjoyed this class more if so much of their pent-up pandemic rage wasnEt misdirected toward this courseEand that includes me. Lots of interesting topics of what happens under the hood of a computer, and many of the exercises make you a better programmer. I just wish that circumstances werenEt so difficult.	CS-107
2	Very challenging but rewarding, very hands on and a lot of debugging practice	CS-107
2	labs and assignments are lengthy and challenging. Do not overload yourself with other courses if you are planning to take this course.	CS-107
2	highly recommend taking this class with chris gregg -- he explains concepts well and is so friendly and absolutely amazing at answering questions on ed. personally i really liked this course; even though it is a little difficult and the assignments are quite time-consuming, the learning curve is not as high as cs106b. you learn so much and labs (section) in particular are super valuable. the material is very useful and important, so i recommend taking cs107 after 106b!	CS-107
2	Get ahead on all assignments	CS-107
2	Honestly this class was very hard but doable. It is way more low level than other CS classes so be ready to think about bits and bytes. However, be ready for heap allocator because that assignment ate up all of my work time the last week of the quarter, which kind of ruins your other classes.	CS-107
2	I didn't find this class super hard, but it takes about 20-25 hours per week, less at the beginning of the quarter and more at the end. I spent more time on this class than math 51 and Econ 1 combined. It should be weighted 10 units. They grade the assignments considerably harder than 106B.	CS-107
2	This is a very challenging course, but very doable if you have the time (10-15 hours a week).	CS-107
2	Start early and start fast. These assignments are manageable within their deadline allotments, but the course is difficult and confusing. Don't rely on OH, the queue is filled within the first minute and rarely reopened. Better to use Ed and struggle through your own late night debugging.	CS-107
2	If you are going to become a CS major this is a must course.	CS-107
2	Great class! Make sure to start on assignments early because they often take a lot longer than you think.	CS-107
2	This course is a rewarding course but just know it will you require you to put in a great deal of effort. The assignments are long and challenging. Best advice would be to start every assignment early.	CS-107
2	Great course to take with Chris Gregg who is one of the most thorough teachers and is able to answer questions in great detail and explain concepts very well	CS-107
2	This course is not too had except for the last 2 assignments which require a significant time commitment. If you have the time and don't procrastinate you will be fine.	CS-107
2	This course is great, the resources for help are very helpful and the assignments are well designed	CS-107
2	As someone whose main focus is AI/ML, there wasn't a lot of material in this class that got me really excited. It basically felt like a tour of protocols and standards that a bunch of old white dudes thought up in the 1970s (x86-64 architecture, how to represent integers and floating point numbers, the C language and assembly) that govern the way our computers work today. Useful, perhaps, if you really need to dig deep into some kind of systems application but limited utility elsewhere. I would have much preferred to take something like the CME 211/212/213 series, but c'est la vie that's not the degree I signed up for. Give yourself lots of time for the last two assignments (Bank Security/Assembly Code and Heap Allocator).	CS-107
2	Save a lot of time towards the end of the quarter for the last two assignments, which are much more time commitment than the first few assignments.	CS-107
2	It is a hard course but it teaches you a lot and it makes you grow.	CS-107
2	The last two assignments are going to take up a lot of time, but don't be scared awayEstart early!!	CS-107
2	Start the last 2 assignments early. Try to go to office hours early because it becomes very difficult to attend near to the assignment deadlines.	CS-107
2	You'll learn a lot, but it's a ton of work - particularly the last few weeks of the quarter. Be prepared for this! Chris Gregg and the TAs are very responsive and helpful. That being said, Chris is a bit all over the place in lecture and can be hard to follow.	CS-107
2	Start early on the assignments. This class is tough but your will learn a lot.	CS-107
2	Despite the last two assignments being challenging and time-consuming, I really enjoyed the class! Chris is an amazing professor, and I've definitely learned a lot in this course.	CS-107
2	Start the last two assignments early. The workload is heavy.	CS-107
2	Chris Gregg is super understanding and encouraging. Debugging in this class can be very frustrating at times. Although this class is known to be hard, it wasn't as bad as i thought.	CS-107
2	Start things EARLY! Who knows when you will get stuck on a bug and how long it will take to figure it out. You cannot rely on office hours they are impossible to get into.	CS-107
2	Take it, if you stay on top of lectures, it's definitely do-able!!	CS-107
2	This is a very difficult class. But it feels amazing to figure out an assignment and to master the material. This is a must-take class, no matter how frustrating it might be.	CS-107
2	I think this is a good course teaching you a lot of skills that can be used later. But be cautious about the workload of it.	CS-107
2	Take it! Chris is so kind and understanding and everything is very well taught	CS-109
2	Not certain how it is with other professors, but Piech's 109 is masterfully crafted. Great Psets in a great new pset app, solid lectures, good sections with helpful problems, and you feel supported throughout. Be prepared to put in a bit more time towards end of quarter w/ machine learning. Highly recommend	CS-109
2	Its an amazing class and if you can take it with Chris Piech	CS-109
2	Take this class!! I've never said this about a class before (then again its my second quarter at Stanford) but the instruction in this class, along with the infrastructure for completing psets was fantastic. Thanks in large part to Chris, I can confidently say I came out of this class refreshed in my interest for probability and its intersection with CS. If you are interested in a CS class and don't have much prior experience (I didn't know python nor had the 103 prereq, did fine) this is the class to take.	CS-109
2	Very well taught. Fun PSETS on awesome PSET app. The exams seemed much harder than the PSETS, which didn't feel awesome.	CS-109
2	Take this class, and take it with Chris Piech. THIS MAN IS JOY INCARNATE and an incredible lecturer. He will make you love probability as much as he does, and be understanding and compassionate throughout the quarter while still challenging you intellectually. The teaching team is awesome and constantly thinking of ways to improve the students' experience in the class. There really isn't much else to say!	CS-109
2	This is definitely one the best classes I have taken at Stanford so far. Chris Piech is pretty much an ideal human and an ideal teacher. He makes the content supper engaging and applicable. With the new way of doing psets, it is super interactive and probably the most fun I have had doing homework ever. I think that if you are not sure about CS, you should try to make it to taking CS109 and then make your decision. I really cannot imagine any way that this class can be improved.	CS-109
2	Chris is a fantastic professor, and my favorite professor at Stanford so far! His charisma really rubs off on you. The course reader for the course is super helpful, and the PSets are actually applicable and fun! Definitely take this course if you are interested in establishing a foundation of the math behind machine learning or artificial intelligence.	CS-109
2	This class is great! Chris is amazing and such a good professor. I wasn't really looking forward to this class, but I absolutely loved it with Chris and the things we learn are SO applicable to real life.	CS-109
2	This class is AWESOME! I highly recommend it even if youEre not a CS/symsys (I wasnEt!). Chris Piech is an awesome awesome instructor. The class very surprisingly became so overwhelming the last week however. Suddenly we started doing machine learning and pretty hard stuff.	CS-109
2	"This is a great course not just for understanding probability theory but also as an introduction to machine learning and how to apply the probability theory that you learn in the first part of the course into practice. Chris is an excellent teacher - one aspect of Chirs' teaching style that particularly helped me is that he explained how and why things came to be - both fundamentally and historically. These could normally be considered minor / not important / trivial - but these things helped me learn and retain concepts quite well. For instance, why the term ""marginal"" means and came to be or that the name logistic regression is a misnomer and is probably better named sigmoidal classification. Chris also explained hard concepts in a very fundamentally sound and elegant manner, that I found quite easy to understand them and retain them. I was also quite lucky to have taken this course when the pset application (that Chis and team created) was first used in this course. It is an amazing tool to learn and understand the concepts and I cannot underestimate the value the pset app had for me in this course Everybody learns differently and so this may not be true for everyone. I have been programmer for many years now, that my brain has trained itself to learn via constant and instant feedback (since that is the nature of programming today) and therefore the pset app helped me tremendously in learning in this course. I had a great fun with the course and learned a lot."	CS-109
2	Amazing course. Chris Piech's passion for computer science and teaching bleeds out of every pore. My favorite class at Stanford so far.	CS-109
2	If you've taken AP stats its a bit of a walk in the park, pay attention after the midterm tho	CS-109
2	ItEs a lot of fun!	CS-109
2	Absolutely take it! Chris Piech is fantastic. Outstanding vibes, energy, and accommodations.	CS-109
2	Great course. I loved the pset app because it made learning the material really engaging and rewarding. Very helpful for providing a foundation for machine learning and AI. Probably my favorite core compsci class yet.	CS-109
2	very cool class	CS-109
2	You will learn a lot. Hopefully, the use of the PSet App is permanent. It allowed us to check whether our answers were Problem Set answers were correct.	CS-109
2	I could recommend this course more! For anyone who curious about the world of probability and artificial intelligence this class is a definite must-take.	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is by far the best CS lecturer. I've had Chris Gregg, Keith Schwarz, Parlante, and Troccoli, and Chris tops all of them. His positive energy is so infectious, and how excited he is on a constant basis about the material makes you as excited about it too. If it weren't for him, I definitely would've hated CS109.	CS-109
2	Take it, especially if it's with Chris Piech! You will learn a lot not just about probability but being creative in applying it.	CS-109
2	This is a fantastic class! Even if you don't have much prior exposure to probability and statistics I imagine you will be able to do quite well and learn a ton in this course if you keep up with lectures and problem sets. This is a class that has a lot of infrastructure in place to make sure you succeed, so make sure you take advantage of that. Chris Piech is a great lecturer and seems to cultivate a really fantastic teaching staff. The problem sets are occasionally challenging, but you work on solving a lot of fun and interesting problems if that keeps your spirits lifted. The last 1.5-2 weeks pick up the pace quite a bit as you cover machine learning algorithms, so be prepared for that, especially if you haven't done any calculus in a while. I'd say that was the most mathematically challenging part of the course, personally.	CS-109
2	This is one of the best classes I've taken, made even better by Professor Chris Piech. The digital course reader is very effective at summarizing content, and the PSET app works amazingly for reinforcing understanding.	CS-109
2	This class is my favorite so far at Stanford, the material is very relevant and fun to learn.	CS-109
2	This course is great!! I feel like I've learned so much and Chris was an amazing lecturer.	CS-109
2	Such a great class! Chris is a fantastic lecturer and the new pset app shows how much he cares about his students' learning. Make sure you start early on the psets and go to office hours.	CS-109
2	Prof Piech, if you can take the course with him, is incredibly kind, supportive, and dedicated to making the course a good experience for students. The emphasis on modeling machine learning towards the end of the course is really neat, and youEll walk away with an appreciation for how probability factors into your life :)	CS-109
2	My favorite class this quarter. The teaching team is so passionate about improving the experience for the students, to the point of building and constantly revising an entirely new app for problem sets and colearning. I highly recommend this to not only the people who have to take it for core major requirements but also anyone interested in understanding probability as it applies to our lives, and how to utilize it effectively with all of the power of computation!	CS-109
2	I recommend this course. I learned a lot and never felt like I was falling majorly behind. The teaching staff was always prepared to answer questions.	CS-109
2	It is a fun class	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is a really good lecturer - course materials (i.e. psets and course readers) were also excellent.	CS-109
2	The problem sets are now on an app and they are so helpful to learn concepts!	CS-109
2	Chris is a great professor who cares a lot about his students and their learning.	CS-109
2	One of the best course and best teachers!	CS-109
2	The class is so good but the final exam is so difficult.	CS-109
2	If you are interested in learning more about how real world phenomena are modeled and interpreted using probability and computing, take this course. Chris is a fantastic instructor!	CS-109
2	Fun and basic introduction to probability. Of course, part of the core for CS, but also quite useful to get a better sense of probability for social science applications.Psets aren't too bad and exams are actually fun and well thought through.	CS-109
2	Solid course! I thought the first half of the course was mostly just high school probability, but the latter half is really interesting. Chris really makes the course so much better!	CS-109
2	this class is great! its also taught in a pretty interesting way. the class was hard though and I don't think I put enough time into learning the material as I should have, but i really liked the material. chris is such a great instructor!!!	CS-109
2	Chris is an absolutely amazing instructor and does a great job making the course materials accessible and interesting. I loved this class and highly recommend it, especially with Chris!	CS-109
2	Absolutely take it! Extremely well structured & well taught. Start the psets early, and it is clear that the teaching team cares about continually improving the course so know that your feedback is valued highly.	CS-109
2	Start the Psets early, and go to office hours,	CS-109
2	Good fun class. Be wary as the course has a stiff learning curve near the end of the quarter as it delves into machine learning.	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is probably the kindest, most enthusiastic lecturer I've had at Stanford, and he makes 109 content very enjoyable. 109's content is very interesting in general.	CS-109
2	Chris Piech is so dope, and his TAs are amazing. I took this class when I had a very heavy course load, and I wish I had waited until I had a more chill schedule. If you can give this class the attention it deserves, it is lit. I am a little slow, so Chris' in-person lectures often move too fast for me unless I have the slides pulled up on my computer and am able to write super quickly. I prefer watching the lectures at home where I can pause it, but this often means i fall 2-3 lectures behind and have to furiously catch up. You won't find a teacher who cares more for the well-being of his students and the world!	CS-109
2	It is a great course where you learn a lot. It is definitely helpful to take it with friends or make friends in the course.	CS-109
2	Chris made this class an awesome experience. The workload is pretty light & the content is fun so definitely take it. A solid intro to stats that's useful for ML classes	CS-109
2	Very well organized with tons of resources	CS-109
2	Excellent instructor!! Some topics can be difficult but Chris makes up for it! My favorite instructor so far	CS-109
2	Great class! Intro to machine learning is very fun	CS-109
2	Definitely take this class! Chris Piech and the teaching team did a great job making the class a fun way to learn about probability and be introduced to machine learning. It is very well designed and organized. Try to start homeworks early (especially if you aren't familiar with the material) and do the practice exams.	CS-109
2	sdf	CS-109
2	Take it! Piech is an amazing teacher.	CS-109
2	Take it! The lectures are great and the P-sets are genuinely fun.	CS-109
2	Very interesting and applicable content. Chris is amazing and his new PSET app helped me understand the content so well. Definitely recommend this class!!	CS-109
2	Chris is a wonderful and passionate instructor. A good theoretical introduction to both data science and machine learning.	CS-109
2	Good course	CS-109
2	Highly recommend. Chris is an excellent instructor.	CS-109
2	It's a great class! Chris Piech is very energetic and motivated and teaches the content well.	CS-109
2	Make sure to know Python and NumPy before attending this course. All the problem sets require you to know Python and you will have an easier time with the problem sets. Also, by knowing Python you will be able to complete the last problem set earlier and it will give you time to study for the final which I did not have. The TA tries to teach you some NumPy at the beginning of the course, but there was so much left out to know, especially in the last two problem sets.	CS-109
2	Chris is the most wonderful CS professor I've had! He is so good at explaining concepts and also very nice and enthusiastic about teaching. He singlehandedly made me interested in probability (hated it in high school). Overall, not too much work, reasonable homework and tests.	CS-109
2	Take it with Chris! The pset app rocks! You are going to learn so much :)	CS-109
2	Enthusiastic teaching by Chris Piech so it made the content much more easy to understand and process, very thorough and I enjoyed his breakdown of concepts and connections to real-world concepts as well	CS-109
2	BEST CLASS AT STANFORD! You learn so much, Chris Piech is amazing, and the material is just fascinating. Highly, highly, recommend.	CS-109
2	Great course and awesome teaching team.	CS-109
2	The TA Staff for my year was VERY GOOD. Office Hours were extremely helpful by them (a must in my opinion) and overall, they all were very nice. I love Chris so much, as he is one of my favorite professors so far.	CS-109
2	This is probably the best introductory class to probability. Chris is a fantastic teacher and makes even the most sophisticated material a piece of cake. There is so much that you can learn from this class.	CS-109
2	Take this course. It's an amazingly well-taught crash course in probability. You will leave it feeling totally versed in an extremely powerful and applicable knowledge area.	CS-109
2	Great instruction, later problem sets can become more difficult	CS-109
2	Absolutely take it! There are a lot of fun assignments.	CS-109
2	"Overall this is a pretty chill class but unfortunately, it was also very disappointing for me. If you actually want to learn probability at a deep level, this is not the course for you and I highly recommend you take additional courses like Math 151 (when taught by a good prof) or some stats classes to supplement CS109 if you have to take it. The course definitely had its moments - I think they did a pretty good job of teaching most combinatorics topics and the instruction on random variables was solid for an intro course. However, a lot of the harder concepts are taught in a super hand-waivey fashion and the theory is rushed or just not even covered so it's very challenging to build a strong mathematical intuition/understanding of what's going on even if you read the course reader. Often concepts are introduced in the context of a pseudocode algorithm (that they will expect you to reproduce in the homework) and little to no background is given on the math/theory that the algorithm is based on. So you end up coding these algorithms out of your ass on the homework and not really understanding why it works/the motivation for it. For example, they did this with bootstrapping and p-values which actually aren't that complicated but they make it confusing by giving you an algorithm for generating a p-value and just being like ""yeah so that's how you get a p-value and it tells you whether or not your measurement was statistically significant, ta-da!"" Instead they should've provided background on hypothesis testing so we understand what a p-value is and where it comes from, then showed us the algorithm. Luckily the midterm was very chill and Chris is very understanding about grades and extensions. The homeworks are also not bad. Usually each homework has 1 or 2 problems that are kind of tricky, but overall they are very mellow. However, the final was actually absurd. I went into that test feeling really good about my understanding of the material and ready to show what I learned. But at least half of the final consisted of probability questions that we had to answer in the form of pseudocode. It did not seem like a probability test at all and a lot really cool topics were left off the final.No disrespect to Chris. I think he's a great guy and seems like a very dedicated dad, but I wasn't a fan of his class."	CS-109
2	This is an excellent introduction to probability and how it applies to computer science. Learning about the theory behind machine learning is very rewarding, and I highly recommend this course. Just make sure not to fall behind, because the material moves quickly.	CS-109
2	AMAZING!! Chris is incredible and the class is great.	CS-109
2	It's a great course, you should take it.	CS-109
2	Take ace! Ian is such a great instructor who can break down the same idea and explain it in so many ways. He writes beautiful section questions with detailed solutions. He has industry experience which is a plus. HeEs knowledgeable about many things beyond CS109 stuff. IEm so glad I had him as a resource.	CS-109
2	Definitely take it along with 109!	CS-109
2	Ian is great!!	CS-109
2	Ian is a fantastic instructor, one who cares for his students deeply and completely. He is so incredibly kind and willing to explain and re-explain topics, and always welcoming of questions (even repeat questions). I would highly recommend taking 109A with Ian Tullis!	CS-109
2	Absolutely take it, especially if Ian is teaching it. He is one-of-a-kind. He is so patient with his students, and he words his answers so carefully to make sure he is giving you the right information in a way that you can digest it. He will be an AMAZING lecturer one day, and Stanford would be SO LUCKY to have him as a full-time faculty.	CS-109
2	Take this course! Chris is really nice and the Ace TA was awesome!	CS-109
2	Make sure to stay up to date with the course because that is the only way the instructor can assist you.	CS-109
2	Ian was helpful!	CS-109
2	This is a great class to take if you want extra support for CS109. Like any supplemental/ace class, you get out what you put in. I often came to class super behind on lecture. But, when I was prepared I found Ian's concept reviews and practice problems to be very helpful - for example his ML section in which we covered Naive Baye's was great, same with his p-values section! Ian is extremely organized and dedicated to his students. His notes and additional practice problems are great! He also has a super solid math background and is very qualified to teach this class. So, if you have time...take this class!	CS-109
1	Cynthia knows her shit and is friendly but is not an engaging lecturer. Given that the material is really dry already, I didn't go to lecture much. Content also too theoretical / abstract for my liking, even if sometimes fairly interesting.	CS-103
1	This is a very abstract course at first and will continue to be not applicable until you get closer to the end. If you have never done any kind of proof writing it will definitely be a challenge at first.	CS-103
1	Office hours are a lifesaver; the content is conceptually not that bad but the problem sets are very time consuming if you don't spread out the work	CS-103
1	Take it if you have any interest at all! While the concepts and problem sets can be challenging, it is very rewarding once you figure stuff out. Start assignments early and make use of office hours. I took it with Cynthia, and her clear enthusiasm about what she was teaching made me that much more excited myself.	CS-103
1	A nice introduction to discrete math and CS theory that eases you into the basics of proof-writing. The first half of the course covers discrete math; theory of computation starts at Week 6. If you have had previous experience writing proofs, the first five weeks will likely feel quite slow. For the Winter 2022 term, lectures were recorded, but the lecture slides were detailed enough that you could treat them as lecture notes, which you could skim faster than watching the lectures at 2x speed. Overall, a solid course for learning the fundamentals of proof-writing and getting a taste for the theory of computation.	CS-103
1	CS103 is a great course & Cynthia is a wonderful professor!	CS-103
1	Super well taught but grading is extremely nitpick-y and annoying so be careful	CS-103
1	It's a good course. You don't really do anything related to computers until Week 6, but it can be fun to puzzle out arguments for the different questions they ask on PSETs. Cynthia's midterms and final were reasonable, and the problem sets are hard but doable.	CS-103
1	This course will have you thinking about math in a very different way if you've never taken a theory class before. The grading can be very detail-oriented for the proofs so make sure you follow the templates and the rules that are clearly laid out for you. Office hours are very hard to get into because they fill up quickly so be the first one there, or ask questions on Ed. It's very convenient that the lectures are recorded so you can watch them at your own pace. Working together with a PSET partner is very beneficial, so make sure you find a good partner and also do some of the work for each problem.	CS-103
1	This course is not too challenging, and quite fun. I enjoyed it very much and it changed how I thought about problems, theorems, and the logic we use to consider them.	CS-103
1	it's genuinely a very interesting course, and Cynthia is a great instructor for it!	CS-103
1	Amazing, satisfying, don't believe the hype that it's super hard/sucks or something like that. so glad I took this!	CS-103
1	Find a p-set group, be meticulous. Double and triple check your answers.	CS-103
1	Everything in the course is useful, make use of your resources!	CS-103
1	Cynthia is a great professor	CS-103
1	If you have a math background, this class will be very easy for you.	CS-103
1	Proofs straddle the line between prose and programming.  Make sure to become comfortable with that narrow valley.Remember your final is worth a huge amount of your grade.  Don't stress over the problem sets but do stress over the midterms and make sure you nail the final.	CS-103
1	take the course with cynthia and make sure you have a really good PSET partner who you work well with. If you do both of these things the course will be easy and stress free	CS-103
1	Make sure that you take this class with ample time in your schedule. I think that there are small details that you can miss when you don't dedicate this class the time that it needs.	CS-103
1	One of my favorite CS classes. A little abstract and not very applicable, but very fun and interesting. Heavy workload, but normal for CS.	CS-103
1	If you don't have mathematical maturity, this class if for you. I wish I had taken it before Math 51 for example... it teaches you how to read and write Math in a very effective way	CS-103
1	Don't take this class if you don't have to. I learned a lot but didn't enjoy the content very much and the homework takes forever. Just not a very enjoyable class. Make sure you get a good partner for the psets.	CS-103
1	This is a time-consuming course that is rewarding; you will learn how to approach mathematical problems in a different way.	CS-103
1	TAs are sometimes not good with grading. Proofs are graded punitively and are unrealistic compared to standards of proof-based math classes. Otherwise it's good.	CS-103
1	You need to understand the material to pass the class, regardless of how much time you put into it. It's definitely a more conceptual class than a lot of CS classes out there and is definitely challenging for many, so don't feel bad if you struggle in this class.	CS-103
1	Having some familiarity with proofs will make the first 1/3 of the quarter much easier, and makes learning the content of the course more manageable	CS-103
1	The couse has 10 psets for 10 weeks and can be very intense.	CS-103
1	if you like CS and proofs, take it.	CS-103
1	You must start PSETs early and use office hours.	CS-103
1	It is a great class and stick with the work and go to all of the lectures.	CS-103
1	This was probably my favorite course in the CS core. Take it with Cynthia! The PSETS and exams were very reasonable, and the teaching team was very accommodating.	CS-103
1	Cynthia is an amazing lecturer. She has some of the most progressive pedagogical practices I've ever seen, which really accelerated my learning in this class.	CS-103
1	This course is one of the most well organized courses I've taken at Stanford. The course material requires you to think, but as long as you pay attention in lecture and be precise, you can do very well!  It also requires you to think a bit differently than other CS classes, so it's very interesting material for someone like me who is new to it!	CS-103
1	Do it! Interesting way to build a mathematical foundation for CS	CS-103
1	Very hard, be prepared and goto office hours	CS-103
1	You will probably not enjoy the tedious work of going over the problem sets and the grading is very harsh in the sense that it is nit picky.	CS-103
1	Professor Bailey Lee is incredible at making difficult material understandable.	CS-103
1	A little tedious if you have proof-writing experience, but ultimately a chill introduction to computability theory.	CS-103
1	The grading of this course is very strict, but the course pushes you a lot. Procrastination will be your worst enemy and office hours will be your best friend.	CS-103
1	There is a huge learning curve but you get used to the grind. Still very time intensive.	CS-103
1	Amazing course, definitely worth teaching. Cynthia makes sure this course is extremely well organized, and the content is very applicable in future courses (e.g. CS161).	CS-103
1	Take it! I really enjoyed the course. Cynthia and the teaching team were very helpful. The lectures were clear.	CS-103
1	This is a great class and Cynthia teaches it in a clear, friendly, and in depth way. Having a good pset partner makes a big difference, so make sure to find someone whose problem solving approach works well with your own.	CS-103
1	do it	CS-103
1	CS103 is challenging, but conquerable, even if you have no background in writing proofs/this type of material. I wouldn't have taken it if not for SymSys, and it might not have been my favorite class in all (it's particularly tedious/not necessarily applicable at times), but there are undoubtedly moments where you come to a rewarding revelation and you forget how much energy it took to generate the result or write up prior dense proofs. I'd recommend trying to become used to not getting everything as soon as possible; it's tempting to want to hammer away until you have a perfect PSet, but it's impractical and hardly feasible, especially if working solo.	CS-103
1	Tough but kinda fun sometimes	CS-103
1	I would recommend taking this class with Cynthia. She is a great lecturer but is also a very very understanding person. This class has some interesting material but is not something I would take if it weren't a requirement. It is essentially a math class that is applied to some CS theory later in the quarter. Office Hours can be very helpful!	CS-103
1	I would say this course, apart from being an excellent background for theoretical CS and any sort of proof-writing, is a very well-taught and well-organized course. It does a great job developing not only your ability to think critically, but also to think creatively and solve problems.	CS-103
1	Good class!	CS-103
1	Amazing course. Challenging but rewarding	CS-103
1	Spend time going through the psets, don't underestimate how long it will take to do them	CS-103
1	Take the course even if you aren't a CS major. The content is VERY different from anything you've seen before, and if you enjoy problem solving and want to learn something new, you will love this course.	CS-103
1	Don't be scared of writing proofs! lots of resources and templates in class that help with that. The latter part of the course does become challenging though	CS-103
1	Make sure to watch lecture recordings and be prepared to spend a lot of time just thinking about the problems	CS-103
1	Almost all of the actually useful stuff taught in the course is after week 6/7. It is a good intro to proof writing if you need it. I was personally not a fan of the material of the course, but it was taught well and may be useful down the road.	CS-103
1	If you have a strong background in proof-writing and discrete math take CS 154 instead. If you are new to proof-writing, I think this class is absolutely perfect.	CS-103
1	Great course, very interesting subject	CS-103
1	Work on the PSETS early as they can take a while. You should work with a partner as well.	CS-103
1	The course genuinely had some interesting content. But 2:30 PM Friday assignment deadlines for PSETs.I wish I just took 154 instead. I don't have much math background, but the course was still way too hand-holdy for my tastes.Boring for the first 8 weeks. Quite difficult towards the end.To be fair, it is quite organized.However, the instructors are quite kind and generally available over Ed.	CS-103
1	Definitely take ACE for this class if you are able to! CS 103 on its own does not have sections, so being in ACE is the only way to get additional exposure to course concepts and practice how to apply concepts learned into class to actual problems. Preston was the best and made sure to cover exactly what the class needed help with. My ACE section was very small so it was very easy to get individual help from the CA and work together with peers. Probably the most helpful thing about ACE is the designated office hours. It is usually a lot easier to get help since the group of people it is serving is much smaller.	CS-103
1	Take it if you are new to proof-based math or if you suspect you will need extra help in the course. At the very least, it is great one-on-one time to ask a TA questions!	CS-103
1	This course is very helpful and honestly I wouldn't have been able to get through CS103 without it.	CS-103
1	In general, this ace course probably isn't as essential as ace courses for other computer science classes. I find that the personal office hours for other computer science classes are most useful but it isn't as needed in this course. Helps understand the material a bit better but not by a ton.	CS-103
2	Lots of proofs, expect to spend a lot of time on problem sets	CS-161
2	It is more work than expected but very thorough.	CS-161
2	Great class. Very important content. Professors very hit or miss but that's unavoidable. Just learn the content and you'll do fine.	CS-161
2	Be prepared for very difficult psets and even harder tests. Obviously you have to take it for the CS major and you will learn a lot, but do not overlook it even though some people will tell you it is easy	CS-161
2	This course has very interesting material and the problems that your are solving are genuinely engaging. However, i think the administration of the course was a bit off this year. The cheating scandal disrupted the flow of things, making it so that we didn't receive feedback on the last three assignments before the final. Of course I understand that the TAs would have to go through every single midterm to check for signs of Honor Code violations. However, this came at the expense of all students. I felt like online office hours were really helpful with the PSETs and understanding material. In person office hours felt a bit more disjointed which was weird. One other thing that I didn't really like was the amount of hand-waving during proofs, which made it a bit more difficult to understand the reasoning behind certain algorithms. This does make it easier for us to digest content, but made it a bit harder to study for the exam where its unclear what information we need to know. The exams are difficult, but they can be difficult for everyone. Remember that its okay not to know everything on the exam and you can still do fine! Just try to actively enjoy the material and talk to the TAs/professors if you have questions.	CS-161
2	I think the course is pretty good - my only suggestion is that the Winter quarter section in particularly was pretty pressed for time, since we had Monday Wednesday class, and lost two Mondays to public holidays. I think we could have benefitted from just a tiny bit more time in lecture, since we often had to skip things so it could feel a bit rushed.I would also say that for me personally, this stuff isn't something that I can just look at once and immediately grok, I needed time to 'pickle' a bit. So start taking a look at your psets early, even if you don't work on them right away.	CS-161
2	This class requires a lot of time - don't take it for granted, and stay on top of all of your material! Go to office hours as much as possible, and make sure to review all of the homework problems prior to exams because many of the problems on exams are modifications of the homework problems.Also, this year's class was largely affected by the large number of people who cheated on this exam. Honestly, we still don't know exactly how many people admitted to cheating or how many people were ultimately caught and punished for their actions, which definitely made this course unfair if people were caught.Aside from this, there are tons of resources available for you to practice, so make sure to take the time to do as much of them as possible.	CS-161
2	The class is designed for students to be able to succeed. It requires regular effort, but no question should be impossible.	CS-161
2	I would emphasize learning a small bit of probability to be able to seamlessly jump in. Otherwise the class is pretty beginner friendly.	CS-161
2	"I didn't expect this class to be as bad as it was - I'm a CS major and I feel like I had heard a lot more hype about CS 107/110 compared to 161. TLDR is that the instructors for the winter are super smart and accomplished in the field, but they don't necessarily understand what it's like to be a student learning these algorithms for the first time and can have a hard time explaining them to someone who doesn't have a background in theoretical math. The psets were very proof/math heavy, so ironically the algorithm design portion of the class was comparatively much easier. I think I will use at least the algorithms portion of the class, but the ratio of ""stuff I will use"" vs ""this isn't useful in practice"" wasn't great.Jose was an incredible section leader and did a great job translating the lectures into concepts a normal person could understand - I wish he had been the one teaching the class! He always would take time before/after section to answer student questions to ensure everyone felt supported. Additionally, he went above and beyond in writing up super helpful guides for various concepts in the class and posting them on Ed.I was very disappointed and frustrated in how the teaching team handled the large amount of cheating on our take-home midterm. We didn't get statistics on how many people cheated, but anecdotally I've heard it was like 25%, which is a significant number of people given the class has around 500 people. They provided an alternative grading scheme that basically made it so that the people who cheated could retract their exams without any grade penalty whatsoever, which sends the message that it's OK to cheat so long as you come clean if you get caught. This class is graded on a curve and as someone who didn't cheat, it's frustrating to know that people literally got ahead at the expense of others and the teaching team seemed to send a message that this was acceptable."	CS-161
2	Great and interesting material. Course is well established with great lecture notes, which makes learning the material easier. Course instructors are not the most pleasant people, but TAs are wonderful.	CS-161
2	The material for this course has been refined and improved over many years, and you can tell. Lecture slides and notes are clear and the flow of the course is smooth. Certainly challenging, but lots of support from the robust teaching team. Moses and Nima specifically are some of the most thoughtful, responsive, and kind professors I've experienced at Stanford.	CS-161
2	Overall, I feel like I wasn't given the resources I needed to succeed in this class. They had pretty strict guidelines for what they expected in terms of proofs and homework solutions, but gave few resources and examples for what these should look like. It is a disorganized and very frustrating class. I find algorithms to be interesting and I like the material, but this class was all over the place. The midterm was ridiculously long and hard, and then they were surprised when a bunch of people cheated. The homeworks are not always clear in terms of expectations but they are graded fairly harshly which is frustrating. there was a lot of conflicting information coming from the TAs in terms of what was expected for our homework assignments and overall the class felt very disorganized. they also took a long time to grade homeworks so it was not always clear where you stood in the class. My guess is they felt overwhelmed by the number of people taking this class and weren't really adequately prepared for how many people took it. Ed posts were also not answered very quickly and in general the homework problems were not clear.	CS-161
2	This class is hard. Make sure you go to office hours. Ask questions. This will get you through the homework. The exams are a different question. You just have to do a lot of practice. They are really challenging.	CS-161
2	Really useful and interesting class -- the lecturers try to make it as engaging as possible!	CS-161
2	Nima and Moses are both really kind and understanding profs, you can tell that they really care about students. The lectures themselves are fine, organization is amazing (having access to lecture notes as well as slides and recorded lectures was huge). Problem sets and exams are def tough tho so be prepared to spend a decent amount of time each week on this class	CS-161
2	It is what it is. Not too bad of a time commitment in terms of workload but the content is a bit more difficult compared to CS 103 or CS 109	CS-161
2	TA team is amazing, coursework is interesting and covers a lot, quite exhausting so try to avoid taking it in a relatively hard and busy quarter.	CS-161
2	ouch	CS-161
2	I did not take CS 103 or CS 109 before this course (but had taken EE 178), the knowledge from CS 103 would have been very helpful to know. This course is very time demanding. Though the material isn't difficult to understand, it can be very hard to develop an intuition for what to apply when without lots of practice or prior knowledge. Sections are very helpful and there is a ton of support, there are OH almost constantly online or in person.	CS-161
2	Definitely learned a lot. It was A LOT of work, and I don't think the instruction was always the best/clearest - but i still learned a lot. Definitely go to office hours, there were a lot of times that the pset questions weren't super clear - or there were key details for the question that you would miss/not be aware were important without going to OH.	CS-161
2	This class is well taught and there are a lot of resources for doing well. The midterm+final format is a lot less stressful than the weekly quiz format offered in other quarters.	CS-161
2	it do be hard	CS-161
2	"You're probably taking this because you have to. I would recommend not taking it with anything else that's difficult. The assignments are extremely long - at some points, I found myself working for 15 hours straight and sometimes through the night on one problem. The TAs do their best, but sometimes they're confused too, and that's not very heartening. Some of the simpler concepts are explained over and over, while the more complex concepts get sped through in one lecture, but still appear on the assignments and exams. I think the toughest thing this quarter was the midterm being ""designed"" for 3 hours but actually taking me all 48 hours of the time it was available to complete. It's unfortunate because I do find the content interesting, but I don't feel like it was taught in a way that I could keep up."	CS-161
2	Keep up with lectures, as we move through concepts quickly.	CS-161
2	take it if you need to - If you take it, CHECK Ed REGULARLY; that's where all announcements are posted. Parts of the course can be hit or miss. The course staff were really accommodating. Lectures were okay though sometimes confusing. The take-home midterm (scheduled to take 3 hours) took 24+ hours for me. Being able to work in partners was very helpful, and assignments were reasonable.	CS-161
2	Take it	CS-161
2	Take it if you have to	CS-161
2	If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to for your major so I don't know if anything I say here matters. It's a very tough but doable class.	CS-161
2	Good class, just everything that is taught can be found online and explained a little bit shorter. The expectations aren't super clear, (ie. for homeworks, whether we needed to write formal proofs, pseudocode or just an explanation, etc). and grading didn't always align with expectations. Also for the midterm, when they said that it would take 3 hours in the 48 hour window and most students took over 15 hours to complete it. Make sure you go to office hours to understand what the teaching team is asking.	CS-161
2	Fun class!	CS-161
2	Great class. Really fun to work on all of the interesting problems on psets. Take it!	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are good people, but easily the worst computer science teachers I have had so far (compared to Piech, Kieth, Chris Gregg, Troccoli, etc.). It just seems like they don't really care about teaching as much. Sometimes they don't really even know what's gunna pop up on the next slide, as they don't make their own. Also, the lectures just do not prepare you for the homework; they skip the most important slides and just never show you how to do things that you need to do. Anyways, you have to take it so I'm just ranting. Have fun.	CS-161
2	Start the homeworks early, go to office hours	CS-161
2	CS 161 has the potential to be an unbelievably interesting class. Unfortunately, the winter quarter offering fell short of that. I found the instruction under Professor Charikar to be very solid, while I found myself learning less in Professor Anari's lectures. The homework assignments were long and quite challenging, and while I learned a lot from many of the problems, I feel like they could have been shorter. The take-home midterm was borderline madness E the professors designed a test that many of my classmates could not finish after 12 hours of work, and a sginificant number of students cheated on it. The final was difficult, but much more fair / doable.	CS-161
2	This is an interesting but tough class. I did well in the pre-reqs but found this to be the hardest class conceptually in the core. There's a problem or two on every PSET that are near-unsolvable without going to OH, so if you want to minimize your time in the class, definitely make use of it. That said, the whole point of the class is that you are able to come up with algorithms for tough problems, so if you want to make the most of the class, try to only go to OH once you're really stuck; for the few topics I went to OH on after only working on a problem for a couple hours, I ended up not being able to figure out related problems on my own on the midterm/final. All in all, it's a good class, but beware that the lectures don't prepare you to solve all the problems like they largely did in CS 103, so try to find a good balance between grit and seeking help at OH.	CS-161
2	Try hard to go to office hours for the PSET and watch youtube videos if you don't understand a specific algorithm in lecture. This class is a marathon so don't get too burnt out at the beginning even though the psets then are very hard.	CS-161
2	The content of the class was interesting, but going to lectures was not very helpful.	CS-161
2	The material was very interesting and struggling through the PSETs is rewarding and where most of the learning will come from! Unfortunately, the instruction in lectures was very hard to consume and not immediately relevant / applicable to the psets always. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on problems because they are often vague and worded poorly.	CS-161
2	Good course for a more in-depth review of algorithms. Cheating was rampant the quarter I took it.	CS-161
2	It's a lot of work and is extremely difficult, but the knowledge you get out of it is extremely rewarding.	CS-161
2	Can be a lot, but just go to office hours a lot to get traction!	CS-161
2	This is one of the most useful classes I have taken at Stanford. The class is tough but it is definitely worth it.	CS-161
2	This is a well-organized and informative class. The lectures and sections are very clear.	CS-161
2	It can be challenging at times - make sure to stay persistent and don't give up! At the end, you will learn a ton.	CS-161
2	This course was fantastic with Nima and Moses. Instruction was top tier and it was extraordinarily well run. 10/10	CS-161
2	This class is a core requirement for the CS major, so I imagine most people taking it have no choice. In this case, there is nothing I can say other than to be prepared for the amount of time it will take from your schedule and adjust plans accordingly.	CS-161
2	When the topics comes together, it's incredibly interesting, and by the end you will have learned a ton. It feels super satisfying when all that you've learned from 106 to 103 and 109 culminates in some interesting algorithm. But the teaching is hit or miss: Moses and Nima (while nice) aren't the best at teaching algorithms in an intuitive way. Often the TAs would simply not show up to office hours, and the grading is super slow (last three HWs were not done by the final), although I guess that was due to the midterm Honor Code issue. It seemed like there was a lot of messy stuff behind the scenes throughout the quarter, but I think future iterations will make it a little less rocky. At the end of the day, I learned a lot and enjoyed it, no matter the admin issues.	CS-161
2	I would recommend as a follow up to CS103	CS-161
2	This class is difficult. Take that into account when figuring out your courseload.	CS-161
2	It is definitely a challenging course but will be rewarding in the end. Utilize office hours and don't fall behind on lectures.	CS-161
2	Good class to learn algorithms and problem solving techniques, but just be aware that class averages for assignments/exams are super high	CS-161
2	& not the best cs couse ive taken	CS-161
2	Wonderful class. Highly recommend.	CS-161
2	Challenging course but better if you attend in person and use all of the resources they give to you!	CS-161
2	This class was not super organized, and it was very frustrating. Multiple times I would go to Office Hours on the day a PSet was due, and the TA would not show up. Mind you, it was still listed on the Calendar, and there was no email announcement or Ed post about it being cancelled or rescheduled. Instruction was not great, I had to rely on Office Hours just to be able to begin most of the problems on the PSet. The midterm was supposed to take 3 hours, but we heard that it took TAs 4+ hours to do it, and it ended up taking me the entire 48 hours it was open to do it (close to 24 hours actually spent working on it) because of its difficulty. I understand this class is known for being hard, but the logistical and teaching staff issues made the class much more of a nightmare than it would've been if the content was the worst thing about the class. I'm sure no one is taking this for fun, but just be warned. Jose was an angel in OHEcould not hav	CS-161
2	I do not feel this class was well organized. There were too many sources and content to cover. There were lectures, lecture notes (to be read after lecture), pre-lecture exercises, post-lecture exercises, textbook reading, section and section problems, psets, and then midterm and final exams. I feel this could have been better synthesized and structured so that students could understand what content was important. The class itself is hard and time consuming, but you will learn a lot.	CS-161
2	Essential topic for a lot of CS so you'll probably have to take it, but you can probably get the same experience doing enough leetcode. There are some really great TAs but the teaching staff as a whole could be relied upon to provide confusing information, delivered an extremely poorly thought out midterm, and for some reason never knew the solutions to homework so getting advice was always a mixed bag.	CS-161
2	This course is difficult but can be interesting. PSets may vary in difficulty	CS-161
2	I feel like algorithms is the type of thing where you either know it or don't...hard to have a methodology to create algorithms	CS-161
2	A ton of work. Instructors are very kind and office hours were key in understanding applications of the material.	CS-161
2	This class was super hard for me, perhaps the hardest class in the CS core. That being said, it was also the class where I learned the most about how to be a better programmer and think critically. (Bonus: as someone who has interviewed / done coding challenges and OAs for internships before taking 161, I can definitely say this class makes it 1000% easier - a lot of the algorithms we learned about are very relevant to coding interviews). In addition, the material is genuinely interesting and engaging. It's definitely a challenging course, though. The material is not always easy to understand and internalize, and part of the difficulty is just applying your knowledge to various situations and creatively thinking. I would recommend starting psets as early as possible and going to office hours for sure. Try to stay on top of the material as it does pile up, especially towards the final exam. The later half of the course was harder than the first half, imo.	CS-161
2	Harder than I thought it would be, PSETS are fine but long. Tests are quite hard.	CS-161
2	Very neat content. This course is one of those that its either you already have the intuition or you don't. If you have the intuition for many problems it makes the course easier and if you don't it takes time to build it but it is not impossible. Take advantage of office hours and help from the TA's. They all really want to help you and don't be afraid to ask questions.	CS-161
2	0	CS-161
2	A great course for an introduction to algorithms. I would suggest taking it with a lighter course load.	CS-161
2	This was a difficult class. Proofread your homework after you type it up, I lost most of my points due to typos in extremely unfortunate places.	CS-161
2	the tests are unbelievably hard compared to the content	CS-161
2	Difficult class	CS-161
2	Dont	CS-161
2	The class is essential for CS students but besides that it's okay depending on when you take it. Overall you will learn a lot more about algorithms and what you learn in this class will be useful for your career. However,	CS-161
2	This class is hard, and the teaching staff even acknowledges this at the beginning. The class also goes fast and you definitely have to put in a lot of work into PSETs and reviewing lectures in order to keep up. However, reflecting back I also can't believe how much I learned in such a short time, and despite still not feeling 100% confident on every concept I feel so much more competent at designing algorithms, and am very grateful to have taken this class. Also Jose CARRIED me in this class--I went to all of his office hours and all of his sections and these truly helped me understand the concepts a lot better!	CS-161
2	This class takes a lot of work and prepare to spend a lot of time on problem sets.	CS-161
2	Things get more interesting the second half of class. Long weekly psets so plan accordingly.	CS-161
2	"Awful class. The exams were so unnecessarily hard, especially the 48 hour midterm they gave us. The midterm was supposed to only take 3 hours but every single person I know in this class spent at least 16 hours on it. The instructors ""apologized"" for it in an Ed announcement, but in the same announcement they basically blamed us and said it's our fault for being perfectionists and spending so long on it. They also proceeded to make the final exam as hard as the COVID 48 hour online exams when it was a 3 hour in person exam. The entire class was absolutely miserable. Don't take this class unless you want to get violated by Moses for 10 weeks straight"	CS-161
2	This class is hard, but okay if you're willing to put in the work! Go to OH for hw! It's helpful :)	CS-161
2	"Taking this class in Winter 2022, the lectures seemed to be incomplete. Keep in mind that all the lecture slides, class notes, and example code were not written by the current instructors, but by Mary Wootters, one of the best lecturers and instructors at Stanford. However, the winter instructors Nima & Moses always seem to be uncomfortable teaching from someone else's words. The lectures were always missing the spirit and energy that world-class instructors deliver when they craft every aspect of their own lectures. Expect to spend a lot of time at office hours and looking through the textbook, as much of the knowledge required for the homework assignments is only briefly mentioned in the lectures. Proofs are ""hand-waved"" away in the lectures but expected with rigor by students. While this quarter's instructors are extremely accomplished and skilled computer scientists, I would wait until Mary teaches 161 again before considering this class."	CS-161
2	DonEt take it with Nima and Moses. Bad course, was not taught well	CS-161
2	The lecturers don't communicate the content well and focus on esoteric details/proofs- I learned almost everything relevant to hw/exams from office hours and section. Hws are extremely time consuming and graded harshly; much more difficult than lecture material, many problems poorly written. The 48hr midterm was brutal (~20 pages, i barely slept during the exam window, still didn't finish in time) and devastating to student mental health. Did not make me want to do more cs/algorithms, felt a bit gate-keeping of the CS major. Highly encourage finding a TA you like/can understand and stick with them in section/OH.	CS-161
2	The class is hard to get a good grade because the medium score is so high. Go to the office hours and check the answer with your friends.	CS-161
2	If you're attentive when watching/attending lecture and give yourself time to think through the homework problems thoroughly, you can really become comfortable with the material. I think that the more effort you can put into solidifying concepts soon after they are presented in lecture (like doing concept checks), the more you will get out of the course. I feel quite satisfied with the pacing of the course and level of difficulty of the problems in psets and exams (although the midterm was a bit much)--it's enough to push you, but not unreasonable. All of the material is organized and there is plenty of support on Ed and in office hours.	CS-161
2	The lectures are super clear and well organized. I thought that Nima and Moses are both clear and conscientious instructors. However, the homeworks can be unnecessarily long and vague, and the TAEs are not always prepared to concisely explain topics.	CS-161
2	Terrible course with a terrible teaching team.	CS-161
2	Make sure you understand the concepts throughly. Try teaching the course to an innocent friend who is fairly smart but never learned about algorithms. It can help you a great deal.	CS-161
2	Fast-paced class, but very worth it	CS-161
2	Don't take this class unless you have to (aka CS majors). Moses and Nima are OK at teaching the material. Homeworks were really hard, and you basically couldn't figure out half the problems without relying on office hours. The midterm was also really hard; it was open for a 48 hour period and meant to take 3 hours, but it took me about 15 hours and there were still problems I didn't know how to do. The final was also pretty hard but at least it was an in person 3-hour sitting, which was much preferred over the format of the midterm. This class honestly sucks a lot, but you have to do it. If you're deciding to take it with Aviad or with Moses and Nima, I'd say that taking it with Moses and Nima is slightly better, but you're still going to have to work hard. Go to office hours and sections to help you get through the homeworks. Exams are pretty hit or miss.	CS-161
2	"I did not enjoy this class with Nima and Moses. I think the lectures were great and the material was fine; in fact, the course provides some of the most applicable skills out of the introductory CS courses. But we never really got to see the true power of the course material in assignments. Every problem in every assignment was some contrived task involving anthropomorphic animals that didn't resemble anything we could actually encounter in real life. They were super uninspiring and felt more tedious than anything else. I rarely felt algorithmically challenged, and most of my time was spent trying to make minor, materially inconsequential modifications to some algorithmic idea to account for edge cases. Grading was also tough---I often suffered a ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" by getting a few points off on multiple questions for minor or unspecified errors---but as long as you put in some work you should be fine."	CS-161
2	It is definitely fast paced, and the quarter I took it (Winter 2022) seemed especially hard compared to previous quarters. The lectures and problem sets take a non-trivial amount of time, and there is a PSET every week. The midterm and final are also very difficult.	CS-161
2	This class is not easy. It's a lot of content in a little amount of time, but you do come out of the class learning a lot. The homeworks and exams can be very difficult, whether it is beneficial to our learning isn't too clear, but you will manage.	CS-161
2	Challenging, but very applicable. Weekly psets are quite time consuming, and exams were difficult	CS-161
2	This class is unfortunately taught badly. Moses seems like he doesn't care about anyone. Was so set on getting those who were cheating, neglected providing empathy about the events of the world and on campus.	CS-161
2	Make sure you review the slides after lecture, and if you watch recorded lectures asynchronously, pause to check your understanding. The midterm and final are very tough.	CS-161
2	Required for major, some interesting but not one of those classes you come out thinking 'I'm stoked I took this'.	CS-161
2	"Would highly recommend against taking this course, but of course it's a CS core requirement. Easily one of the worst classes I have taken at Stanford. Somehow, it seems like the professors and the TAs aren't even engaged in their own course. Problem sets are disorganized and the staff gives out conflicting info. The teaching staff considers 24 pages to be a ""reasonable"" two-day midterm."	CS-161
2	The lectures are really good, and the concept checks are very challenging but low-stakes (because you won't be graded for them). Algorithms is as much an art as it is a science, so it shouldn't be surprising to find the first few psets to be very hard. In particular, the second problem set is the rite of passage, so watch out!	CS-161
2	To be honest, this class was very hard (I took it with Moses and Nima). The professors instructed the TAs (at least I know this is true for the ones who had remote office hours, which were the only ones I went to) to be barely helpful; TAs would rarely help you walk through a problem and you had to come to office hours with the problem mostly attempted or with questions, which is fine, but I had a hard time even getting started with a problem due to not knowing how to even attempt it.	CS-161
2	This is a tricky course. There is a lot of content and the midterm and final are definitely hard. It is doable if you keep up with lecture, go to office hours and read the lecture notes.	CS-161
2	Don't take it with Moses and Nima. The material is interesting, but the course they teach is extremely disorganized. The lectures were needlessly confusing, I ended up relying on my section TA to explain the concepts to me and went to office hours for every single pset. They administered a 48 hour take home midterm and had a ton of honor code violations. This class could have been great but there was a lot of needless confusion and stress that it was the worst CS class I've taken at Stanford.	CS-161
2	The content of this course is really interesting and essential for CS majors, but the teaching team felt a little messy this quarter. It felt like the priority was on making students work rather than helping students learn. Moses tends to be a more clear lecturer than Nima, but lots of lectures just have too much content to fit into a single 90 minutes. I could not get through problem sets without OH.	CS-161
2	This is not a very fun course and a substantial amount of work. It was pretty organized and well-taught. You have to take it to go through the CS core so keep your head up and you'll get through it. Make sure you find a strong support system in the class (friends and TAs) to get through it.	CS-161
2	It's a pretty hard course, homeworks and exams are quite difficult and often times felt like far away in difficulty from lecture material. Start the asssignments early and go to office hours	CS-161
2	"Take it if you have to. Moses and Nima seem like great people, but they (especially Nima) are not great at teaching. Nima in particular will waffle a lot and tell you to ""convince yourself that it is true"" for the material that you came to class to learn. The ethics lectures are poorly integrated as well - they just felt like extra work and they didn't really relate to the things that we were learning. We could have been looking at examples of how algorithms had led to ethical issues, but we didn't. The problem sets are also often confusingly worded and require a lot of time in office hours to solve."	CS-161
2	This is a tough class, with very conceptualy challenging content and really difficult assignments. There seemed to often be a big jump between assignments and lectures, so go to OHs as early and often as you need to get a handle on why the problems are the way they are. Without the lovely TAs/CAs that were helping us throughout the quarter, I wouldn't have made it past any of the assignments. The midterms and finals for this year were extremely difficult, specifically the final. So if you have to take this class for your major/minor, expect to put in a LOT of effort if you want a decent grade.	CS-161
2	Start the homeworks ASAP, budget your time out, and stay caught up on lectures, or you will find the second half of the class very difficult	CS-161
2	I can see how the content is useful especially for coding interviews. But for me it just felt like a very time consuming course and I questioned why I was taking it in the end since I donEt plan on doing software engineering in the future. The course involved a lot of proofs in addition to algorithm desig	CS-161
2	This is a no-nonsense class as introduction to algorithms and algorithmic analysis. Much of the work is straightforward from what's learned, but be prepared to think.	CS-161
2	Please attend OHs, and go to section. It'll make things easier.	CS-161
2	This course will probably take up most of your time. Make sure to take it with easier courses!	CS-161
2	This class is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken at Stanford. I required office hours to do every problem set but the TAs are great and so supportive. Be prepared for VERY hard exams. The lecture's aren't super well taught but if you are confused about concepts there are more than enough office hours and sections to get your questions answered.	CS-161
2	You have to take it for the CS major, but if you're anything like me, you won't like it. I felt incredibly reliant on office hours to make any progress on the problem sets, and the take-home midterm they said should take 3 hours took me the whole two days it was out for. The TAs (especially Jose & Jerry) were amazing though, and I think Moses and Nima were good lecturers too. I personally just found the content very difficult and uninspiring.	CS-161
2	A pretty hard class. A mix of 106b and 103. Midterm, which was take-home, was really hard. I felt it was a bad idea to assign it on weekdays, which meant that if you had classes during those days, you'd be at a disadvantage. Probably very useful for interviews (the 106b material makes a lot more sense when they get a mathematical treatment). Second half with graphs and dynamic programming is imo harder than the first half, which is mainly just 106b review. It's a cs core class, so you have to take it. Nima and Moses are alright.	CS-161
2	This is a very tough course. It is not easy. The content is confusing, and takes a lot of time to wrap your head around. It is a fun class to take but be prepared for long PSETS and struggles in understanding material. It is very rewarding, however!	CS-161
2	asf	CS-161
2	I really enjoyed a lot of the content in 161, but the class logistics were a messed up. Our homework took forever to grade (3+ weeks sometimes), they gave us a midterm that took more than twice as long as they told us it would, and a lot of the TAs never showed up to office hours.	CS-161
2	This course is quite difficult, not only because of the content itself, but because of the instruction and learning gap between lectures and psets.	CS-161
2	Really straightforward class. Watch the lectures, do the pset each week, finish the midterm, complete the final, and that's all that counts for your grade. They also offer a lot of supplementary material (sections, pre-lecture exercises, post-lecture concept checks). I felt like I got a lot out of the course just doing the pre-lecture exercises before lecture and going over the section problems to study for exams, but you'll ultimately get out what you put in.	CS-161
2	Terrible experience all around. Some of the psets were so tedious and long, even with partners it was difficult to finish. Midterm was so ridiculously difficult that allegedly half the class retracted the test. And the final was tough (not comparable to the practice exams from in-person quarters which were in comparison very doable), though this was expected since they probably wanted to punish the people who retracted the midterm. Ed responsiveness is also lower than most other core classes.Only mild positive is that the lectures were pretty good (albeit rushed at the end at times - Moses is the better lecturer of the two), and Jerry and Jose's backs are frickin yoked from carrying the entire TA team. If you ever go to office hours and it's not one of them hosting it, the TA will tell you to just make a post on Ed and wait for Jerry, Jose, or Moses to respond, pretty much the only 3 helpful people among the staff. Rest of the TAs are incredibly unhelpful.	CS-161
2	Quality class, a lot of work goes into the labs and staying ahead. Not hard to catch up but wouldn't recommend falling behind.	CS-161
2	If you are not planning on majoring in CS or taking advanced courses in analysis of algorithms I don't think this class is necessary. It covers some interesting algorithms, but not from a programming approach.	CS-161
2	"Took with Nima and Moses. This class sucks. It is sad, because it has the potential of being super interesting, and the content is actually relevant (esp for coding interviews). But instruction sucks and you end up wasting so much time doing self-learning, chasing around office hours for the *few* TAs who are actually good to try to understand what you are supposed to do in the weekly psets which are really disconnected from lectures, and the exams are very hard. While this class is called ""DESIGN and ANALYSIS"" of algorithms, all they do is make you memorize a few famous algorithms and then formally analyze and prove them. They do not teach you any actual design skills and just expect you to come up with crazy intuitions during psets and exams to design certain algorithms. This quarter, they gave us a take-home midterm for 48h which was ""designed to be taken in 3h"" but most students worked on it for >10h and still could not finish. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to (in which case, I am so sorry for you)."	CS-161
2	It's a hard class and this year had a chaotic honor code mess. The professors are fine people (I guess) but are really lazy (i.e. most if not all responsibilities fall on TAs like writing exams and all other logistics) while they just read off of Mary Wooter's slides. By far the worst CS core class. But I guess its a necessary evil. Take it only if you need to.	CS-161
2	Conceptually, much different from other theory/CS courses. Be prepared to think about algorithms a lot	CS-161
2	Instructors don't teach well. Tests are harder than they need to be.	CS-161
2	Pros: This class is very helpful if you're a CS major going for SWE. Technical interviews feel way easier after taking 161. Plus, algorithms are pretty fundamental to CS in general. You'll feel a lot more confident with CS after this class. Plus, the PSETs often feel like solving puzzles, so if you enjoy that, you should enjoy the problem sets. Lastly, the TAs are amazing. Cons: This class is incredibly difficult. Sometimes, the lectures feel like they are jumping around and skipping steps (took with Moses and Nima). Definitely be ready to put in time and effort to succeeding in this class.	CS-161
2	Take this class.	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are good lecturers with great slides and explained hard or nuanced concepts well within a short lecture time. There were some instances in which the proof or explanation of something was being left for students to figure out, which was a huge contrast from 107 or 103 where we were walked through each step clearly. Response times and quality on Ed were unpredictable. Some TAs wrote impressively good responses. At other times, replies were slow compared to the other CS core classes, and most of the times, responses would come from other students. The professors and TAs would purposely refrain from answering some questions in hopes that other students would chip in. There were cases in which questions about the HW were left unanswered days after the HW was due. Concept checks were a good metric but provide solutions for them in future quarters. Even though section is optional and one section was recorded, I wish more section times were offered. This was the only CS class where the TA consistently got through the entire section handout, so kudos for that!I LIVED in office hours for the latter half of this course. TAs were very helpful and did comprehensive walkthroughs for some problems. There were often big differences between the TA's levels of helpfulness or even barebones interpretation of HW questions though - example, on whether a rigorous proof is required, or which approach to take to solve a question, which made things frustrating and confusing.Problem sets were helpful for learning the material. Some were too long, one had unreasonably complicated questions, and a fair amount of ambiguities. At one point, I felt that HW scores were not a representation of one's ability but rather how much time they have to go to office hours and squeeze out answers or clarifications from the TAs. HWs need to be designed better to remove such problems. HW grades could've been released in a more timely manner.The midterm was like a hackathon during the week. It was long with very tough questions, but I don't know how it could've been improved. So many students cheated, and I don't even know if all of them were identified, which is annoying. The midterm and final were both on the difficult end. Everything is left up to the curve and how your peers do, which isn't ideal since some students already know this material from tech interviews or competitive math.Everyone talks about 107 and 103, but 161's difficulty can catch you off guard. Part of this is because algorithms is inherently a hard class.All in all, I learned a lot from this course about a number of important topics in algorithms. Take 103 before. This course is already hard enough if you know proofs, so make sure you are comfortable with induction, contradiction, and other concepts from 103. 109 is helpful for the randomized algo section but not much. Study for this course in advance. This course is so fast paced, and 4 weeks is not enough time to go from hearing the terms dynamic programming and greedy for the first time to confidently taking a final exam about them. Doing well on these topics so quickly takes an insane amount of practice or mathematical background.	CS-161
2	really important and helpful class, it will help you design much more efficient code	CS-161
2	This class is very interesting and the material itself is not the hardest, making the learning very enjoyable and manageable. I highly recommend taking this class if you are into math and learning about how algorithms work, even if you are not a CS major.	CS-161
2	Great course that helps you develop a new way of thinking. Definitely go to section, and start early on the homework and assessments. Section leaders and teaching team were fantastic and very helpful throughout.	CS-161
2	nothing	CS-161
2	Another great class by the CS department. Really cool to see how a lot of these work. Take if you enjoy problem solving/puzzles.	CS-161
2	algorithms :)	CS-161
2	I don't recommend taking it with Moses and Nima, I felt they did not explain the concepts well in lectures and the psets were extremely long. While the content was very interesting and useful, I felt that I spent most of my time working through many more problems than would be necessary, and I ended up learning most of the content from reading the slides and going to office hours because it was not explained well in lecture.	CS-161
2	This is probably the worst class in the CS core I've taken. Moses is a good instructor but Nima's lectures are very confusing and hard to follow. Additionally, the teaching staff are very disorganized and often not on the same page about PSET problems and expectations -- of the office hours available, only a few TA's actually can explain the material and meaningfully help with the PSETs (shoutout to Goli for being an amazing TA!). The exams were terribly organized as well - the take home midterm was unreasonably long and took the whole 48 hour window. Meanwhile, the final didn't resemble any of the practice tests and had very hard questions.	CS-161
2	The psets can be long and the exams are really challenging depends on whether you can come up with algorithms on the spot	CS-161
2	Go to office hours and engage with other students!	CS-161
2	This class is interesting and also decently hard. It's a good amount of work and some of the psets are pretty time consuming. Try to start psets early and stay ahead.	CS-161
2	It's worth taking.  You'll learn some basic knowledge that seems like it will be crucial for CS.	CS-161
2	Go to office hours. The grading is very harsh and you're unlikely to do well without attending office hours and getting clarification from a TA on the expected answers and what is needed to fulfill the rubric. A small mistake could cost you a lot of marks as there's almost no credit given for partial solutions. Also, make sure you stay on top of the forums, often the homework questions are unclear, and you might need to rewrite your solutions after the clarifications are posted.	CS-161
2	This course is one of the most difficult courses in the CS core. I'm being upfront when I say that one has to be on top of the content. Personally, I relied on lecture too much to learn the content and only realized at the end of the quarter that I needed more supplementary material. Office hours and Ed Discussion carried me through this class. Just be aware that the difference between what is learned in lecture and what is expected in the PSETS is pretty stark. I suggest putting substantial time into this class.	CS-161
2	This is by far the worst CS class I have taken at Stanford. If you have any option at all, I would do everything and anything I can to avoid taking this course, including changing your major. It is an absolute shame Stanford put this in the CS core, and until they re-imagine the class or change the CS core requirements, I wouldn't recommend being a CS major or CS masters student. The instruction was very poor, the class was boring and there was no clear use for the majority of the content. I have been in industry for almost 10 years, and we didn't cover a single thing that would've come in handy to me. Additionally, the professors created many situations that incentivized cheating, meaning those of us that take the honor code seriously were at a stark disadvantage.	CS-161
2	I have a love-hate relationship with this class. in summary, this is the hardest class I've ever taken not only because the content is difficult to learn and to teach but mainly because the class was so unorganized. One main frustration is going to office hours where TAs are missing this happened to me three times, and I've heard of other students who would go to office hours and no TA would show up as well. Two main improvements the class can make are focusing the lectures on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information. Instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini-quizzes to replace the midterm and final.I liked the content and found it interesting and overall I think I will get a good grade because I sacrificed a sufficient amount of my time and mental health to perform well on the psets and exams. However, the whole process was more difficult than it needed to be because the lectures just aren't very understandable and you have to do a lot of teaching your self the content and the exam logistics/office hours/TAs/and grading process as a whole are very unorganized and could be vastly improved to create a better experience for the TAs and the students.The midterm was absurdly long and difficult. It was essentially a pset and so many students cheated a new grading scheme had to be created. I believe this mess could've been avoided if instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini quizzes that don't could for as much of our grade and figuring out a way to make the homework more digestible and aligned with what we learned in class. I often couldn't complete the homework on my own and had to go to office hours to try to figure out where to start. I found Jose's office hours the most helpful because he would break the problem down and help us think through the problem whereas other TAs often would circumvent my question or in the process of trying to avoid saying to much about the homework they would leave me more confused than I began. Additionally, it seemed like each TA had different approaches to the problem because there were instances where I would ask TAs certain questions about the homework but get marked down for reasons I was told by another TA we're okay. I understand this content is difficult to teach but I often learned little from lectures and other TAs and instead relied on grinding by myself, Jose's office hours, and talking through content with my peers. I think the professor and teaching team need to take a hard look at this class to re-evaluate what is the most important info to share during lecture to help students understand the concepts and how the teaching team can put themselves in the student's shoes and remember what it was like learning this content for the first time so that they can break it down in a way that makes sense for new learners.For instance, I stopped watching lectures and would just walk through the slides at my own pace to learn concepts from a lecture because the lecture went too fast and didn't explain everything. Specifically the hashing lecture I remember that one being very dense. I would prefer covering less content but understanding the content covered rather than blowing through content. I think a lot of the lectures should focus on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information.For instance, maybe cover certain topics in lecture so students understand and then make supplemental videos where you break down the more complicated advanced topics you would want to cover but didn't have time for. This way students can review on their own time since students are already reviewing the content on their own time anyway.	CS-161
2	I mean youre taking it cuz its required, but its better than 107 or 103, and feels more applicable.	CS-161
2	This is a very difficult class. Think of it like a harder version of CS 103 but without the scrupulous grading critiques. Moses was a great lecturer and in hindsight, I think I learned the most from him as well as Jose and Jerry, two of the amazing TAs we had this quarter. The problem with this class is that the examples given in lecture don't prepare you at all for the homework problems. I basically had to rely on office hours for 70% of the homeworks this quarter. On the other hand, although I probably should've went to a few office hours when I took 103, the homeworks were doable without it, which I think is fair. The midterm was insanely difficult, and it definitely gives an advantage to people who have the full two days to work on it, as it is practically another homework assignment. I find it incredible they actually expected us to finish that test in 3 hours. I only had a day to work on it and didn't even finish the last problem. The final was definitely more fair, although the dynamic programming problem is just way too hard to give for an in-person timed exam. Overall, this is a required course so for CS majors you probably don't have any choice. As for other majors, be aware that this course is a challenge.	CS-161
2	I liked Moses' style of lecturing and I felt that typically I understood his lectures meanwhile I really did not like Nima's style of lecturing. I think the best part of this class is when they let us have PSET partners for submissions, when that happened this class became so much more bearable. Aside from that I think this class starts off not too bad and then you hit dynamic programming and things become a lot harder than they need to be. My biggest piece of advice is try to know like 3-4 people who are also taking this class because that will really save you in the end.	CS-161
2	Good course, definitely take it	CS-161
2	Definitely a very important course!	CS-161
2	"The slides and course material are good. The lecturer also teaches the course well.However, you may not expect responsible TAs in the class. Often, the questions in discussion forum can be solved in time. And the TAs make many mistaking in grading. You'd better propose exactly the same answer as the solution by going to office hour. Otherwise, it is very likely that your hw can be graded incorrectly. There is even a case that I lose credit because of ""too much"" demonstration."	CS-161
2	Great class. Can be difficult at times but take advantage of office hours and the course staff.	CS-161
2	Really challenging course but helpful for building algorithm knowledge. Teaching team was unresponsive to the students' needs and did not make any changes based on feedback. Handled academic dishonesty poorly and only lost trust from students. Exams and assignments were much harder than class material and teaching team did not seem to want to answer our questions properly and help us succeed. It was almost as if they wanted us not to do well in this class. I genuinely wanted to have fun and learn, but they made it really hard to do so because I felt I had to worry so much about my grade and being able to get all the psets done (they were so so long).	CS-161
2	This class was way worse than any other cs class I've taken. it's incredibly disorganized in the winter, and packs way too much information in 2 lectures a week. The psets are never representative of the material in lecture, and the exams are made to be extremely difficult. Most people go to office hours to do the PSET and its not atypical to see the entirety of huang basement packed with people to get PSET answers during office hours as they're nearly impossible to come to a solution to using the information from lecture.	CS-161
2	If you're gonna take this class, be ready for extremely long and hard PSETs and insanely difficult exams. Try not to take it with Nima & Moses if you can.	CS-161
2	Tough class and required for CS. Make sure you are thorough in your answers	CS-161
2	Find a good TA who will carry you through. Find a supportive group of people to work with. This class is very, very challenging and the psets will not be a good time. That being said, if you put in the time, you'll learn a lot! The content is actually very interesting and relevant to technical coding interviews.	CS-161
2	Great course for algorithms intro.	CS-161
2	Lots of proofs, expect to spend a lot of time on problem sets	CS-161
2	It is more work than expected but very thorough.	CS-161
2	Great class. Very important content. Professors very hit or miss but that's unavoidable. Just learn the content and you'll do fine.	CS-161
2	It's taught fine, but the psets are inordinately time-consuming.	CS-161
2	Moses taught the material in a fairly structured and logical manner, but Nima's lectures felt a bit disorganized at times. Many of the problem sets were extremely time consuming. The general consensus among students seemed to be that midterm exam was too long, and the final exam was too difficult. But, if you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. Good luck!	CS-161
2	Be prepared for very difficult psets and even harder tests. Obviously you have to take it for the CS major and you will learn a lot, but do not overlook it even though some people will tell you it is easy	CS-161
2	This course has very interesting material and the problems that your are solving are genuinely engaging. However, i think the administration of the course was a bit off this year. The cheating scandal disrupted the flow of things, making it so that we didn't receive feedback on the last three assignments before the final. Of course I understand that the TAs would have to go through every single midterm to check for signs of Honor Code violations. However, this came at the expense of all students. I felt like online office hours were really helpful with the PSETs and understanding material. In person office hours felt a bit more disjointed which was weird. One other thing that I didn't really like was the amount of hand-waving during proofs, which made it a bit more difficult to understand the reasoning behind certain algorithms. This does make it easier for us to digest content, but made it a bit harder to study for the exam where its unclear what information we need to know. The exams are difficult, but they can be difficult for everyone. Remember that its okay not to know everything on the exam and you can still do fine! Just try to actively enjoy the material and talk to the TAs/professors if you have questions.	CS-161
2	I think the course is pretty good - my only suggestion is that the Winter quarter section in particularly was pretty pressed for time, since we had Monday Wednesday class, and lost two Mondays to public holidays. I think we could have benefitted from just a tiny bit more time in lecture, since we often had to skip things so it could feel a bit rushed.I would also say that for me personally, this stuff isn't something that I can just look at once and immediately grok, I needed time to 'pickle' a bit. So start taking a look at your psets early, even if you don't work on them right away.	CS-161
2	This class requires a lot of time - don't take it for granted, and stay on top of all of your material! Go to office hours as much as possible, and make sure to review all of the homework problems prior to exams because many of the problems on exams are modifications of the homework problems.Also, this year's class was largely affected by the large number of people who cheated on this exam. Honestly, we still don't know exactly how many people admitted to cheating or how many people were ultimately caught and punished for their actions, which definitely made this course unfair if people were caught.Aside from this, there are tons of resources available for you to practice, so make sure to take the time to do as much of them as possible.	CS-161
2	The class is designed for students to be able to succeed. It requires regular effort, but no question should be impossible.	CS-161
2	It's a lot of work, and the paradigms are among the most beautiful things I've ever learned.	CS-161
2	"I didn't expect this class to be as bad as it was - I'm a CS major and I feel like I had heard a lot more hype about CS 107/110 compared to 161. TLDR is that the instructors for the winter are super smart and accomplished in the field, but they don't necessarily understand what it's like to be a student learning these algorithms for the first time and can have a hard time explaining them to someone who doesn't have a background in theoretical math. The psets were very proof/math heavy, so ironically the algorithm design portion of the class was comparatively much easier. I think I will use at least the algorithms portion of the class, but the ratio of ""stuff I will use"" vs ""this isn't useful in practice"" wasn't great.Jose was an incredible section leader and did a great job translating the lectures into concepts a normal person could understand - I wish he had been the one teaching the class! He always would take time before/after section to answer student questions to ensure everyone felt supported. Additionally, he went above and beyond in writing up super helpful guides for various concepts in the class and posting them on Ed.I was very disappointed and frustrated in how the teaching team handled the large amount of cheating on our take-home midterm. We didn't get statistics on how many people cheated, but anecdotally I've heard it was like 25%, which is a significant number of people given the class has around 500 people. They provided an alternative grading scheme that basically made it so that the people who cheated could retract their exams without any grade penalty whatsoever, which sends the message that it's OK to cheat so long as you come clean if you get caught. This class is graded on a curve and as someone who didn't cheat, it's frustrating to know that people literally got ahead at the expense of others and the teaching team seemed to send a message that this was acceptable."	CS-161
2	Great and interesting material. Course is well established with great lecture notes, which makes learning the material easier. Course instructors are not the most pleasant people, but TAs are wonderful.	CS-161
2	The material for this course has been refined and improved over many years, and you can tell. Lecture slides and notes are clear and the flow of the course is smooth. Certainly challenging, but lots of support from the robust teaching team. Moses and Nima specifically are some of the most thoughtful, responsive, and kind professors I've experienced at Stanford.	CS-161
2	Overall, I feel like I wasn't given the resources I needed to succeed in this class. They had pretty strict guidelines for what they expected in terms of proofs and homework solutions, but gave few resources and examples for what these should look like. It is a disorganized and very frustrating class. I find algorithms to be interesting and I like the material, but this class was all over the place. The midterm was ridiculously long and hard, and then they were surprised when a bunch of people cheated. The homeworks are not always clear in terms of expectations but they are graded fairly harshly which is frustrating. there was a lot of conflicting information coming from the TAs in terms of what was expected for our homework assignments and overall the class felt very disorganized. they also took a long time to grade homeworks so it was not always clear where you stood in the class. My guess is they felt overwhelmed by the number of people taking this class and weren't really adequately prepared for how many people took it. Ed posts were also not answered very quickly and in general the homework problems were not clear.	CS-161
2	This class is hard. Make sure you go to office hours. Ask questions. This will get you through the homework. The exams are a different question. You just have to do a lot of practice. They are really challenging.	CS-161
2	Really useful and interesting class -- the lecturers try to make it as engaging as possible!	CS-161
2	You learn a lot about computer algorithms and this course teaches you really important concepts!	CS-161
2	Nima and Moses are both really kind and understanding profs, you can tell that they really care about students. The lectures themselves are fine, organization is amazing (having access to lecture notes as well as slides and recorded lectures was huge). Problem sets and exams are def tough tho so be prepared to spend a decent amount of time each week on this class	CS-161
2	TA team is amazing, coursework is interesting and covers a lot, quite exhausting so try to avoid taking it in a relatively hard and busy quarter.	CS-161
2	ouch	CS-161
2	Great for coding interviews, start your hws on time + go to OH	CS-161
2	I did not take CS 103 or CS 109 before this course (but had taken EE 178), the knowledge from CS 103 would have been very helpful to know. This course is very time demanding. Though the material isn't difficult to understand, it can be very hard to develop an intuition for what to apply when without lots of practice or prior knowledge. Sections are very helpful and there is a ton of support, there are OH almost constantly online or in person.	CS-161
2	Definitely learned a lot. It was A LOT of work, and I don't think the instruction was always the best/clearest - but i still learned a lot. Definitely go to office hours, there were a lot of times that the pset questions weren't super clear - or there were key details for the question that you would miss/not be aware were important without going to OH.	CS-161
2	This class is well taught and there are a lot of resources for doing well. The midterm+final format is a lot less stressful than the weekly quiz format offered in other quarters.	CS-161
2	it do be hard	CS-161
2	"You're probably taking this because you have to. I would recommend not taking it with anything else that's difficult. The assignments are extremely long - at some points, I found myself working for 15 hours straight and sometimes through the night on one problem. The TAs do their best, but sometimes they're confused too, and that's not very heartening. Some of the simpler concepts are explained over and over, while the more complex concepts get sped through in one lecture, but still appear on the assignments and exams. I think the toughest thing this quarter was the midterm being ""designed"" for 3 hours but actually taking me all 48 hours of the time it was available to complete. It's unfortunate because I do find the content interesting, but I don't feel like it was taught in a way that I could keep up."	CS-161
2	Keep up with lectures, as we move through concepts quickly.	CS-161
2	Nima and Moses are cuties. Hard class though. But cool; definitely more interesting than 103.	CS-161
2	This course was not my thing. I found it rather boring but the class is well structured and run well.	CS-161
2	An extreme, ridiculous amount of work.	CS-161
2	take it if you need to - If you take it, CHECK Ed REGULARLY; that's where all announcements are posted. Parts of the course can be hit or miss. The course staff were really accommodating. Lectures were okay though sometimes confusing. The take-home midterm (scheduled to take 3 hours) took 24+ hours for me. Being able to work in partners was very helpful, and assignments were reasonable.	CS-161
2	Take it	CS-161
2	This is a challenging but very rewarding course. The skills you learn will also help you succeed in algorithmic interview questions.	CS-161
2	You probably have to take it for your major anyways.  If you don't there's not too much of a point.	CS-161
2	If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to for your major so I don't know if anything I say here matters. It's a very tough but doable class.	CS-161
2	Good class, just everything that is taught can be found online and explained a little bit shorter. The expectations aren't super clear, (ie. for homeworks, whether we needed to write formal proofs, pseudocode or just an explanation, etc). and grading didn't always align with expectations. Also for the midterm, when they said that it would take 3 hours in the 48 hour window and most students took over 15 hours to complete it. Make sure you go to office hours to understand what the teaching team is asking.	CS-161
2	The teaching staff was more concerned with ensuring academic honesty than over well being and learning for the class. Some CA's would not help at all at office hours while others would. Overall, it sucks that CS students need to take this for a requirement because the class is so poorly taught.	CS-161
2	Fun class!	CS-161
2	Great class. Really fun to work on all of the interesting problems on psets. Take it!	CS-161
2	Start the homeworks early, go to office hours	CS-161
2	This course covers a lot of content and is very fast paced, but the content is extremely interesting. The midterm was 48 hours and very difficult. The midterm (and the whole class) was a wave of emotion - sometimes it was fun coming up with algorithms, other times it was very miserable. Nima and Moses are decent instructors, and it was easy to follow along for the most part.	CS-161
2	CS 161 has the potential to be an unbelievably interesting class. Unfortunately, the winter quarter offering fell short of that. I found the instruction under Professor Charikar to be very solid, while I found myself learning less in Professor Anari's lectures. The homework assignments were long and quite challenging, and while I learned a lot from many of the problems, I feel like they could have been shorter. The take-home midterm was borderline madness E the professors designed a test that many of my classmates could not finish after 12 hours of work, and a sginificant number of students cheated on it. The final was difficult, but much more fair / doable.	CS-161
2	This is an interesting but tough class. I did well in the pre-reqs but found this to be the hardest class conceptually in the core. There's a problem or two on every PSET that are near-unsolvable without going to OH, so if you want to minimize your time in the class, definitely make use of it. That said, the whole point of the class is that you are able to come up with algorithms for tough problems, so if you want to make the most of the class, try to only go to OH once you're really stuck; for the few topics I went to OH on after only working on a problem for a couple hours, I ended up not being able to figure out related problems on my own on the midterm/final. All in all, it's a good class, but beware that the lectures don't prepare you to solve all the problems like they largely did in CS 103, so try to find a good balance between grit and seeking help at OH.	CS-161
2	Just a really poorly run class. Almost half of our psets (3/8) were ungraded at the time of the final. The instructors would refuse to offer in-depth explanations to practice final questions on Ed and instead suggest that another student step up and explain it... days before the final. Answer keys were often unreliable and riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. Some answers were clearly written by TAs without a very strong grasp on the topic. Oh, and the midterm was by far the most unreasonable exam I've ever seen at Stanford, even though it was take-home! Don't take unless it's mandatory, and even then I wouldn't suggest taking it with Moses/Nima.	CS-161
2	Try hard to go to office hours for the PSET and watch youtube videos if you don't understand a specific algorithm in lecture. This class is a marathon so don't get too burnt out at the beginning even though the psets then are very hard.	CS-161
2	The content of the class was interesting, but going to lectures was not very helpful.	CS-161
2	I would tell the student that homework requires a significant amount of time, and to make sure to go over problems with peers to make sure that they didn't make any silly mistakes that could easily be fixed.	CS-161
2	Most of the work in this class are the PSETs. Make sure to start them early, and refer to lecture notes often when you are stuck.	CS-161
2	It's a lot of work and is extremely difficult, but the knowledge you get out of it is extremely rewarding.	CS-161
2	Can be a lot, but just go to office hours a lot to get traction!	CS-161
2	This is a well-organized and informative class. The lectures and sections are very clear.	CS-161
2	The lectures do not coincide with the PSETs: the PSETs are much harder. There is quite the disconnect between how simple the lectures seem and how difficult the PSETs are. Also, just note, probably one of the most difficult midterms I've taken at Stanford. 22 pages take home...	CS-161
2	It can be challenging at times - make sure to stay persistent and don't give up! At the end, you will learn a ton.	CS-161
2	This course was fantastic with Nima and Moses. Instruction was top tier and it was extraordinarily well run. 10/10	CS-161
2	This class is a core requirement for the CS major, so I imagine most people taking it have no choice. In this case, there is nothing I can say other than to be prepared for the amount of time it will take from your schedule and adjust plans accordingly.	CS-161
2	When the topics comes together, it's incredibly interesting, and by the end you will have learned a ton. It feels super satisfying when all that you've learned from 106 to 103 and 109 culminates in some interesting algorithm. But the teaching is hit or miss: Moses and Nima (while nice) aren't the best at teaching algorithms in an intuitive way. Often the TAs would simply not show up to office hours, and the grading is super slow (last three HWs were not done by the final), although I guess that was due to the midterm Honor Code issue. It seemed like there was a lot of messy stuff behind the scenes throughout the quarter, but I think future iterations will make it a little less rocky. At the end of the day, I learned a lot and enjoyed it, no matter the admin issues.	CS-161
2	I would recommend as a follow up to CS103	CS-161
2	This class is difficult. Take that into account when figuring out your courseload.	CS-161
2	Good class to learn algorithms and problem solving techniques, but just be aware that class averages for assignments/exams are super high	CS-161
2	& not the best cs couse ive taken	CS-161
2	Wonderful class. Highly recommend.	CS-161
2	Challenging course but better if you attend in person and use all of the resources they give to you!	CS-161
2	This class was not super organized, and it was very frustrating. Multiple times I would go to Office Hours on the day a PSet was due, and the TA would not show up. Mind you, it was still listed on the Calendar, and there was no email announcement or Ed post about it being cancelled or rescheduled. Instruction was not great, I had to rely on Office Hours just to be able to begin most of the problems on the PSet. The midterm was supposed to take 3 hours, but we heard that it took TAs 4+ hours to do it, and it ended up taking me the entire 48 hours it was open to do it (close to 24 hours actually spent working on it) because of its difficulty. I understand this class is known for being hard, but the logistical and teaching staff issues made the class much more of a nightmare than it would've been if the content was the worst thing about the class. I'm sure no one is taking this for fun, but just be warned. Jose was an angel in OHEcould not hav	CS-161
2	Essential topic for a lot of CS so you'll probably have to take it, but you can probably get the same experience doing enough leetcode. There are some really great TAs but the teaching staff as a whole could be relied upon to provide confusing information, delivered an extremely poorly thought out midterm, and for some reason never knew the solutions to homework so getting advice was always a mixed bag.	CS-161
2	This course is difficult but can be interesting. PSets may vary in difficulty	CS-161
2	This class is really hard. Expect to spend lots of time on the psets.	CS-161
2	I feel like algorithms is the type of thing where you either know it or don't...hard to have a methodology to create algorithms	CS-161
2	A ton of work. Instructors are very kind and office hours were key in understanding applications of the material.	CS-161
2	This class was super hard for me, perhaps the hardest class in the CS core. That being said, it was also the class where I learned the most about how to be a better programmer and think critically. (Bonus: as someone who has interviewed / done coding challenges and OAs for internships before taking 161, I can definitely say this class makes it 1000% easier - a lot of the algorithms we learned about are very relevant to coding interviews). In addition, the material is genuinely interesting and engaging. It's definitely a challenging course, though. The material is not always easy to understand and internalize, and part of the difficulty is just applying your knowledge to various situations and creatively thinking. I would recommend starting psets as early as possible and going to office hours for sure. Try to stay on top of the material as it does pile up, especially towards the final exam. The later half of the course was harder than the first half, imo.	CS-161
2	Harder than I thought it would be, PSETS are fine but long. Tests are quite hard.	CS-161
2	Very neat content. This course is one of those that its either you already have the intuition or you don't. If you have the intuition for many problems it makes the course easier and if you don't it takes time to build it but it is not impossible. Take advantage of office hours and help from the TA's. They all really want to help you and don't be afraid to ask questions.	CS-161
2	0	CS-161
2	"This course definitely takes more time than what a 5 unit course should be. Grading is pretty harsh on proofs, and they're very particular about wording everything exactly. Even though the homework assignments are very hard and very time consuming, everyone scores close to perfect on them, which is super stressful since the class is graded on a curve. Our midterm exam was supposed to take 3 hours, but the overall consensus was that the 22 page take home midterm took people AT LEAST 16 hours and above. Course instructors are super out of touch with the experiences of an average Stanford student. I really did give this course the good old college try, but basically to get an A, you'll have to end up camping office hours for the homework solutions. Moses and Nima say that if you work hard, you can get a good grade, but in my experience, if you work hard, there's no way for you to do super well other than being EXTREMELY nitpicky on your own assignments, rather than truly understanding the material. The wording for homework is pretty convoluted, so if you don't check Edstem clarification posts, there's often no way you will get the correct answer. If you submit reasonable answers based on the unclear wording, you'll get docked for points and then the justification is that ""we cleared up misunderstandings on Ed,"" which is extremely frustrating because the instructions should've been written well in the first place. You could understand the material and still get screwed over because everyone's perfect, meaning that there's pressure on you to be perfect as well or else you'll get screwed over by the curve. It's very frustrating because the amount of effort you put in for an assignment will not reflect the end result grade on homework assignments that you will get. I came into this course very excited to learn about the content and am leaving it extremely frustrated with how ethics lectures are jammed in, how the weekly time commitment is a lot, and about how learning is absolutely destroyed because myself and others will tend to focus on the small nitpicky parts of grades as a result of how this class is structured. The instructors are well-meaning and very clear about their intentions to not harm students, but good intentions don't consistently substitute for a good learning experience."	CS-161
2	Pretty difficult class with long psets at the beginning and lots of content covered but it is all necessary	CS-161
2	161 is a pretty tough class, but you probably knew that already. The teaching staff is okay, but they rush through some harder topics it feels. A lot of the learning and aha moments have to be done yourself. Midterm was brutal. psets can be okay, but some unfair questions every now and then that just destroy a week.Take with caution.	CS-161
2	This was a difficult class. Proofread your homework after you type it up, I lost most of my points due to typos in extremely unfortunate places.	CS-161
2	the tests are unbelievably hard compared to the content	CS-161
2	Difficult class	CS-161
2	Psets are time consuming, but  you will learn a lot about how to design algorithms well.	CS-161
2	Dont	CS-161
2	The class is essential for CS students but besides that it's okay depending on when you take it. Overall you will learn a lot more about algorithms and what you learn in this class will be useful for your career. However,	CS-161
2	This class is hard, and the teaching staff even acknowledges this at the beginning. The class also goes fast and you definitely have to put in a lot of work into PSETs and reviewing lectures in order to keep up. However, reflecting back I also can't believe how much I learned in such a short time, and despite still not feeling 100% confident on every concept I feel so much more competent at designing algorithms, and am very grateful to have taken this class. Also Jose CARRIED me in this class--I went to all of his office hours and all of his sections and these truly helped me understand the concepts a lot better!	CS-161
2	Things get more interesting the second half of class. Long weekly psets so plan accordingly.	CS-161
2	Great course but very time-consuming! Start psets early and go to office hours. Exams are very tough.	CS-161
2	"Awful class. The exams were so unnecessarily hard, especially the 48 hour midterm they gave us. The midterm was supposed to only take 3 hours but every single person I know in this class spent at least 16 hours on it. The instructors ""apologized"" for it in an Ed announcement, but in the same announcement they basically blamed us and said it's our fault for being perfectionists and spending so long on it. They also proceeded to make the final exam as hard as the COVID 48 hour online exams when it was a 3 hour in person exam. The entire class was absolutely miserable. Don't take this class unless you want to get violated by Moses for 10 weeks straight"	CS-161
2	its a difficult class but you can learn a lot if you put in the time to. i think the profs did care about us, even though the tests were really difficult. the staff was pretty supportive and the TAs were amazing (especially Jerry and Jose)	CS-161
2	This class is hard, but okay if you're willing to put in the work! Go to OH for hw! It's helpful :)	CS-161
2	Midterm was extremely difficult because it was take home and did not take the allotted number of times. The first few PSETs can be quite difficult and the difficulty of each PSET is not uniform. However, in-person office hours are really good and the TAs were knowledgeable so definitely take advantage of that.	CS-161
2	"Taking this class in Winter 2022, the lectures seemed to be incomplete. Keep in mind that all the lecture slides, class notes, and example code were not written by the current instructors, but by Mary Wootters, one of the best lecturers and instructors at Stanford. However, the winter instructors Nima & Moses always seem to be uncomfortable teaching from someone else's words. The lectures were always missing the spirit and energy that world-class instructors deliver when they craft every aspect of their own lectures. Expect to spend a lot of time at office hours and looking through the textbook, as much of the knowledge required for the homework assignments is only briefly mentioned in the lectures. Proofs are ""hand-waved"" away in the lectures but expected with rigor by students. While this quarter's instructors are extremely accomplished and skilled computer scientists, I would wait until Mary teaches 161 again before considering this class."	CS-161
2	DonEt take it with Nima and Moses. Bad course, was not taught well	CS-161
2	The lecturers don't communicate the content well and focus on esoteric details/proofs- I learned almost everything relevant to hw/exams from office hours and section. Hws are extremely time consuming and graded harshly; much more difficult than lecture material, many problems poorly written. The 48hr midterm was brutal (~20 pages, i barely slept during the exam window, still didn't finish in time) and devastating to student mental health. Did not make me want to do more cs/algorithms, felt a bit gate-keeping of the CS major. Highly encourage finding a TA you like/can understand and stick with them in section/OH.	CS-161
2	The lectures are super clear and well organized. I thought that Nima and Moses are both clear and conscientious instructors. However, the homeworks can be unnecessarily long and vague, and the TAEs are not always prepared to concisely explain topics.	CS-161
2	Terrible course with a terrible teaching team.	CS-161
2	Make sure you understand the concepts throughly. Try teaching the course to an innocent friend who is fairly smart but never learned about algorithms. It can help you a great deal.	CS-161
2	Don't take this class unless you have to (aka CS majors). Moses and Nima are OK at teaching the material. Homeworks were really hard, and you basically couldn't figure out half the problems without relying on office hours. The midterm was also really hard; it was open for a 48 hour period and meant to take 3 hours, but it took me about 15 hours and there were still problems I didn't know how to do. The final was also pretty hard but at least it was an in person 3-hour sitting, which was much preferred over the format of the midterm. This class honestly sucks a lot, but you have to do it. If you're deciding to take it with Aviad or with Moses and Nima, I'd say that taking it with Moses and Nima is slightly better, but you're still going to have to work hard. Go to office hours and sections to help you get through the homeworks. Exams are pretty hit or miss.	CS-161
2	"I did not enjoy this class with Nima and Moses. I think the lectures were great and the material was fine; in fact, the course provides some of the most applicable skills out of the introductory CS courses. But we never really got to see the true power of the course material in assignments. Every problem in every assignment was some contrived task involving anthropomorphic animals that didn't resemble anything we could actually encounter in real life. They were super uninspiring and felt more tedious than anything else. I rarely felt algorithmically challenged, and most of my time was spent trying to make minor, materially inconsequential modifications to some algorithmic idea to account for edge cases. Grading was also tough---I often suffered a ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" by getting a few points off on multiple questions for minor or unspecified errors---but as long as you put in some work you should be fine."	CS-161
2	It is definitely fast paced, and the quarter I took it (Winter 2022) seemed especially hard compared to previous quarters. The lectures and problem sets take a non-trivial amount of time, and there is a PSET every week. The midterm and final are also very difficult.	CS-161
2	Be prepared to work hard	CS-161
2	This class is not easy. It's a lot of content in a little amount of time, but you do come out of the class learning a lot. The homeworks and exams can be very difficult, whether it is beneficial to our learning isn't too clear, but you will manage.	CS-161
2	This course is amazing! It is a must-take for anyone pursuing any technical / engineering degree at Stanford. Every field uses algorithms in some form or fashion. This course gives you an immense understanding and appreciation for algorithms and data structures that is super helpful for anyone in an engineering or technical field.	CS-161
2	Challenging, but very applicable. Weekly psets are quite time consuming, and exams were difficult	CS-161
2	This class is unfortunately taught badly. Moses seems like he doesn't care about anyone. Was so set on getting those who were cheating, neglected providing empathy about the events of the world and on campus.	CS-161
2	Required for major, some interesting but not one of those classes you come out thinking 'I'm stoked I took this'.	CS-161
2	Not a great class. Only take it if you absolutely have to (in which case I feel sorry for you).	CS-161
2	Jose is the BEST ta! I found the teaching team to be too intleligent to explain thigns at my level but a good TA can really carry you through the Course.	CS-161
2	"Would highly recommend against taking this course, but of course it's a CS core requirement. Easily one of the worst classes I have taken at Stanford. Somehow, it seems like the professors and the TAs aren't even engaged in their own course. Problem sets are disorganized and the staff gives out conflicting info. The teaching staff considers 24 pages to be a ""reasonable"" two-day midterm."	CS-161
2	The lectures are really good, and the concept checks are very challenging but low-stakes (because you won't be graded for them). Algorithms is as much an art as it is a science, so it shouldn't be surprising to find the first few psets to be very hard. In particular, the second problem set is the rite of passage, so watch out!	CS-161
2	To be honest, this class was very hard (I took it with Moses and Nima). The professors instructed the TAs (at least I know this is true for the ones who had remote office hours, which were the only ones I went to) to be barely helpful; TAs would rarely help you walk through a problem and you had to come to office hours with the problem mostly attempted or with questions, which is fine, but I had a hard time even getting started with a problem due to not knowing how to even attempt it.	CS-161
2	Very tough	CS-161
2	This is a tricky course. There is a lot of content and the midterm and final are definitely hard. It is doable if you keep up with lecture, go to office hours and read the lecture notes.	CS-161
2	Don't take it with Moses and Nima. The material is interesting, but the course they teach is extremely disorganized. The lectures were needlessly confusing, I ended up relying on my section TA to explain the concepts to me and went to office hours for every single pset. They administered a 48 hour take home midterm and had a ton of honor code violations. This class could have been great but there was a lot of needless confusion and stress that it was the worst CS class I've taken at Stanford.	CS-161
2	The content of this course is really interesting and essential for CS majors, but the teaching team felt a little messy this quarter. It felt like the priority was on making students work rather than helping students learn. Moses tends to be a more clear lecturer than Nima, but lots of lectures just have too much content to fit into a single 90 minutes. I could not get through problem sets without OH.	CS-161
2	This is not a very fun course and a substantial amount of work. It was pretty organized and well-taught. You have to take it to go through the CS core so keep your head up and you'll get through it. Make sure you find a strong support system in the class (friends and TAs) to get through it.	CS-161
2	It's a pretty hard course, homeworks and exams are quite difficult and often times felt like far away in difficulty from lecture material. Start the asssignments early and go to office hours	CS-161
2	Start the homeworks ASAP, budget your time out, and stay caught up on lectures, or you will find the second half of the class very difficult	CS-161
2	I can see how the content is useful especially for coding interviews. But for me it just felt like a very time consuming course and I questioned why I was taking it in the end since I donEt plan on doing software engineering in the future. The course involved a lot of proofs in addition to algorithm desig	CS-161
2	This is a no-nonsense class as introduction to algorithms and algorithmic analysis. Much of the work is straightforward from what's learned, but be prepared to think.	CS-161
2	Assignments are lengthy and challenging. Lots of pseudocode to write. Do not overload yourself with other courses if you are planning to take this course. Start assignments early, go to office hours for clarifications, work with classmates.	CS-161
2	This class is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken at Stanford. I required office hours to do every problem set but the TAs are great and so supportive. Be prepared for VERY hard exams. The lecture's aren't super well taught but if you are confused about concepts there are more than enough office hours and sections to get your questions answered.	CS-161
2	Great course, Moses is an awesome lecturer. Content is definitely useful and applicable, but unless you have prior experience in algorithms don't take it your freshman year.	CS-161
2	You have to take it for the CS major, but if you're anything like me, you won't like it. I felt incredibly reliant on office hours to make any progress on the problem sets, and the take-home midterm they said should take 3 hours took me the whole two days it was out for. The TAs (especially Jose & Jerry) were amazing though, and I think Moses and Nima were good lecturers too. I personally just found the content very difficult and uninspiring.	CS-161
2	A pretty hard class. A mix of 106b and 103. Midterm, which was take-home, was really hard. I felt it was a bad idea to assign it on weekdays, which meant that if you had classes during those days, you'd be at a disadvantage. Probably very useful for interviews (the 106b material makes a lot more sense when they get a mathematical treatment). Second half with graphs and dynamic programming is imo harder than the first half, which is mainly just 106b review. It's a cs core class, so you have to take it. Nima and Moses are alright.	CS-161
2	This course contains incredibly practical material. Algorithms are the core of practical, performant software, and they're very important for internship interviews in CS. That said, all the interesting and important material is buried in anthropomorphic animal hell. The course materials look like they're designed for small children, not college students.	CS-161
2	This is a very tough course. It is not easy. The content is confusing, and takes a lot of time to wrap your head around. It is a fun class to take but be prepared for long PSETS and struggles in understanding material. It is very rewarding, however!	CS-161
2	asf	CS-161
2	I really enjoyed a lot of the content in 161, but the class logistics were a messed up. Our homework took forever to grade (3+ weeks sometimes), they gave us a midterm that took more than twice as long as they told us it would, and a lot of the TAs never showed up to office hours.	CS-161
2	As a core cs class, you have to take it and you will be better after taking it. However, if you have to take it with Moses and/or Nima it definitely highlights so many pain points in the CS department. This class can really kill the joy for CS. For reference, I'm on the systems track. There is a way to teach difficult content in a EfairE effective way. This class did not do this. In fact, this has been a class my least favorite class of the entire core (except 109). Lectures are horrible. Bruh up on the different types of algorithms (youTube, geeks4geeks), 103 (reviewing old psets), and 109 (in depth 109 review needed!! this class can get unnecessarily heavy on the 109). Moses and Nima are very intelligent and want people to succeed, but don't actually teach. Lecture is a bunch of crammed slides with dense material and very little time to understand it before the next pset is due. Homework is unreasonably challenging, half my time was spent just trying to understand what they were asking/talking about. Go to Office Hours early, because OH at the end of the week is SO AWFULLY unhelpful. Find a good TA and make time to go to their OH and/or section because you will waste so much time just trying to understand what they're asking - just to be wrong.  	CS-161
2	Terrible experience all around. Some of the psets were so tedious and long, even with partners it was difficult to finish. Midterm was so ridiculously difficult that allegedly half the class retracted the test. And the final was tough (not comparable to the practice exams from in-person quarters which were in comparison very doable), though this was expected since they probably wanted to punish the people who retracted the midterm. Ed responsiveness is also lower than most other core classes.Only mild positive is that the lectures were pretty good (albeit rushed at the end at times - Moses is the better lecturer of the two), and Jerry and Jose's backs are frickin yoked from carrying the entire TA team. If you ever go to office hours and it's not one of them hosting it, the TA will tell you to just make a post on Ed and wait for Jerry, Jose, or Moses to respond, pretty much the only 3 helpful people among the staff. Rest of the TAs are incredibly unhelpful.	CS-161
2	Quality class, a lot of work goes into the labs and staying ahead. Not hard to catch up but wouldn't recommend falling behind.	CS-161
2	If you are not planning on majoring in CS or taking advanced courses in analysis of algorithms I don't think this class is necessary. It covers some interesting algorithms, but not from a programming approach.	CS-161
2	"Took with Nima and Moses. This class sucks. It is sad, because it has the potential of being super interesting, and the content is actually relevant (esp for coding interviews). But instruction sucks and you end up wasting so much time doing self-learning, chasing around office hours for the *few* TAs who are actually good to try to understand what you are supposed to do in the weekly psets which are really disconnected from lectures, and the exams are very hard. While this class is called ""DESIGN and ANALYSIS"" of algorithms, all they do is make you memorize a few famous algorithms and then formally analyze and prove them. They do not teach you any actual design skills and just expect you to come up with crazy intuitions during psets and exams to design certain algorithms. This quarter, they gave us a take-home midterm for 48h which was ""designed to be taken in 3h"" but most students worked on it for >10h and still could not finish. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to (in which case, I am so sorry for you)."	CS-161
2	It's a hard class and this year had a chaotic honor code mess. The professors are fine people (I guess) but are really lazy (i.e. most if not all responsibilities fall on TAs like writing exams and all other logistics) while they just read off of Mary Wooter's slides. By far the worst CS core class. But I guess its a necessary evil. Take it only if you need to.	CS-161
2	Conceptually, much different from other theory/CS courses. Be prepared to think about algorithms a lot	CS-161
2	Instructors don't teach well. Tests are harder than they need to be.	CS-161
2	The slides for this class are helpful and the sections are very helpful as well.	CS-161
2	Take this class.	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are good lecturers with great slides and explained hard or nuanced concepts well within a short lecture time. There were some instances in which the proof or explanation of something was being left for students to figure out, which was a huge contrast from 107 or 103 where we were walked through each step clearly. Response times and quality on Ed were unpredictable. Some TAs wrote impressively good responses. At other times, replies were slow compared to the other CS core classes, and most of the times, responses would come from other students. The professors and TAs would purposely refrain from answering some questions in hopes that other students would chip in. There were cases in which questions about the HW were left unanswered days after the HW was due. Concept checks were a good metric but provide solutions for them in future quarters. Even though section is optional and one section was recorded, I wish more section times were offered. This was the only CS class where the TA consistently got through the entire section handout, so kudos for that!I LIVED in office hours for the latter half of this course. TAs were very helpful and did comprehensive walkthroughs for some problems. There were often big differences between the TA's levels of helpfulness or even barebones interpretation of HW questions though - example, on whether a rigorous proof is required, or which approach to take to solve a question, which made things frustrating and confusing.Problem sets were helpful for learning the material. Some were too long, one had unreasonably complicated questions, and a fair amount of ambiguities. At one point, I felt that HW scores were not a representation of one's ability but rather how much time they have to go to office hours and squeeze out answers or clarifications from the TAs. HWs need to be designed better to remove such problems. HW grades could've been released in a more timely manner.The midterm was like a hackathon during the week. It was long with very tough questions, but I don't know how it could've been improved. So many students cheated, and I don't even know if all of them were identified, which is annoying. The midterm and final were both on the difficult end. Everything is left up to the curve and how your peers do, which isn't ideal since some students already know this material from tech interviews or competitive math.Everyone talks about 107 and 103, but 161's difficulty can catch you off guard. Part of this is because algorithms is inherently a hard class.All in all, I learned a lot from this course about a number of important topics in algorithms. Take 103 before. This course is already hard enough if you know proofs, so make sure you are comfortable with induction, contradiction, and other concepts from 103. 109 is helpful for the randomized algo section but not much. Study for this course in advance. This course is so fast paced, and 4 weeks is not enough time to go from hearing the terms dynamic programming and greedy for the first time to confidently taking a final exam about them. Doing well on these topics so quickly takes an insane amount of practice or mathematical background.	CS-161
2	really important and helpful class, it will help you design much more efficient code	CS-161
2	This class is very interesting and the material itself is not the hardest, making the learning very enjoyable and manageable. I highly recommend taking this class if you are into math and learning about how algorithms work, even if you are not a CS major.	CS-161
2	Likely redundant for most students, but required for the major.	CS-161
2	Great course that helps you develop a new way of thinking. Definitely go to section, and start early on the homework and assessments. Section leaders and teaching team were fantastic and very helpful throughout.	CS-161
2	The course is very well taught and the TAs are incredible.  Moreover, all the knowledge gained is very practical - you learn problem solving skills.	CS-161
2	This class was a traumatic experience from start to finish. The TAs for this course are incompetent at best and actually offer conflicting information on the problem sets. I find it truly strange that the TAs themselves don't seem to be on the same page at all on the problems, so I don't understand how the course staff expect the students to come up with the correct solution. With the exception of a couple TAs, most TAs are also very reluctant to give out solutions, which I totally understand, but it starts to get ridiculous when even basic questions go unanswered and it feels like you cannot get any help at all. The problem sets themselves are long and arduous, and quite frankly very difficult to complete without going to OH weekly multiple times--you need to have flashes of intuition which is tricky to develop. I would basically sit in OH all week and hope that TAs gave out some nuggets of information. Moses' lecturing was alright but Nima's was often scattered and left me more confused than when I started. The content is already difficult to begin with, so the lackluster lecturing certainly does not help. The midterm was also startlingly long (although it was supposed to take 3 hours, which was a complete lie) and I imagine the final will be a similar situation. Overall, this class has significantly dampened my mental health this quarter and I cannot wait for this experience to be over. If you're a CS major, you have to take this course (which I do believe is the hardest of the CS core, even more so than 110), so I just grit your teeth and try to get through it.	CS-161
2	Another great class by the CS department. Really cool to see how a lot of these work. Take if you enjoy problem solving/puzzles.	CS-161
2	algorithms :)	CS-161
2	I don't recommend taking it with Moses and Nima, I felt they did not explain the concepts well in lectures and the psets were extremely long. While the content was very interesting and useful, I felt that I spent most of my time working through many more problems than would be necessary, and I ended up learning most of the content from reading the slides and going to office hours because it was not explained well in lecture.	CS-161
2	This is probably the worst class in the CS core I've taken. Moses is a good instructor but Nima's lectures are very confusing and hard to follow. Additionally, the teaching staff are very disorganized and often not on the same page about PSET problems and expectations -- of the office hours available, only a few TA's actually can explain the material and meaningfully help with the PSETs (shoutout to Goli for being an amazing TA!). The exams were terribly organized as well - the take home midterm was unreasonably long and took the whole 48 hour window. Meanwhile, the final didn't resemble any of the practice tests and had very hard questions.	CS-161
2	The psets can be long and the exams are really challenging depends on whether you can come up with algorithms on the spot	CS-161
2	Go to office hours and engage with other students!	CS-161
2	This class is interesting and also decently hard. It's a good amount of work and some of the psets are pretty time consuming. Try to start psets early and stay ahead.	CS-161
2	It's worth taking.  You'll learn some basic knowledge that seems like it will be crucial for CS.	CS-161
2	Go to office hours. The grading is very harsh and you're unlikely to do well without attending office hours and getting clarification from a TA on the expected answers and what is needed to fulfill the rubric. A small mistake could cost you a lot of marks as there's almost no credit given for partial solutions. Also, make sure you stay on top of the forums, often the homework questions are unclear, and you might need to rewrite your solutions after the clarifications are posted.	CS-161
2	This is by far the worst CS class I have taken at Stanford. If you have any option at all, I would do everything and anything I can to avoid taking this course, including changing your major. It is an absolute shame Stanford put this in the CS core, and until they re-imagine the class or change the CS core requirements, I wouldn't recommend being a CS major or CS masters student. The instruction was very poor, the class was boring and there was no clear use for the majority of the content. I have been in industry for almost 10 years, and we didn't cover a single thing that would've come in handy to me. Additionally, the professors created many situations that incentivized cheating, meaning those of us that take the honor code seriously were at a stark disadvantage.	CS-161
2	This class is difficult, but rewarding. I definitely left this class with more knowledge than I had going into it. Though a lot of work, I believe that the skillset you develop in this class makes everything worth it.	CS-161
2	I have a love-hate relationship with this class. in summary, this is the hardest class I've ever taken not only because the content is difficult to learn and to teach but mainly because the class was so unorganized. One main frustration is going to office hours where TAs are missing this happened to me three times, and I've heard of other students who would go to office hours and no TA would show up as well. Two main improvements the class can make are focusing the lectures on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information. Instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini-quizzes to replace the midterm and final.I liked the content and found it interesting and overall I think I will get a good grade because I sacrificed a sufficient amount of my time and mental health to perform well on the psets and exams. However, the whole process was more difficult than it needed to be because the lectures just aren't very understandable and you have to do a lot of teaching your self the content and the exam logistics/office hours/TAs/and grading process as a whole are very unorganized and could be vastly improved to create a better experience for the TAs and the students.The midterm was absurdly long and difficult. It was essentially a pset and so many students cheated a new grading scheme had to be created. I believe this mess could've been avoided if instead of having a long midterm and final this class would do better have more frequent mini quizzes that don't could for as much of our grade and figuring out a way to make the homework more digestible and aligned with what we learned in class. I often couldn't complete the homework on my own and had to go to office hours to try to figure out where to start. I found Jose's office hours the most helpful because he would break the problem down and help us think through the problem whereas other TAs often would circumvent my question or in the process of trying to avoid saying to much about the homework they would leave me more confused than I began. Additionally, it seemed like each TA had different approaches to the problem because there were instances where I would ask TAs certain questions about the homework but get marked down for reasons I was told by another TA we're okay. I understand this content is difficult to teach but I often learned little from lectures and other TAs and instead relied on grinding by myself, Jose's office hours, and talking through content with my peers. I think the professor and teaching team need to take a hard look at this class to re-evaluate what is the most important info to share during lecture to help students understand the concepts and how the teaching team can put themselves in the student's shoes and remember what it was like learning this content for the first time so that they can break it down in a way that makes sense for new learners.For instance, I stopped watching lectures and would just walk through the slides at my own pace to learn concepts from a lecture because the lecture went too fast and didn't explain everything. Specifically the hashing lecture I remember that one being very dense. I would prefer covering less content but understanding the content covered rather than blowing through content. I think a lot of the lectures should focus on teaching content that students will understand rather than blowing through information.For instance, maybe cover certain topics in lecture so students understand and then make supplemental videos where you break down the more complicated advanced topics you would want to cover but didn't have time for. This way students can review on their own time since students are already reviewing the content on their own time anyway.	CS-161
2	Don' take it in winter	CS-161
2	Lots of resources from the staff. Midterm can be very hard. Instructors are good at presenting different topics however HW instructions can be ambiguous at times.	CS-161
2	This is a very difficult class. Think of it like a harder version of CS 103 but without the scrupulous grading critiques. Moses was a great lecturer and in hindsight, I think I learned the most from him as well as Jose and Jerry, two of the amazing TAs we had this quarter. The problem with this class is that the examples given in lecture don't prepare you at all for the homework problems. I basically had to rely on office hours for 70% of the homeworks this quarter. On the other hand, although I probably should've went to a few office hours when I took 103, the homeworks were doable without it, which I think is fair. The midterm was insanely difficult, and it definitely gives an advantage to people who have the full two days to work on it, as it is practically another homework assignment. I find it incredible they actually expected us to finish that test in 3 hours. I only had a day to work on it and didn't even finish the last problem. The final was definitely more fair, although the dynamic programming problem is just way too hard to give for an in-person timed exam. Overall, this is a required course so for CS majors you probably don't have any choice. As for other majors, be aware that this course is a challenge.	CS-161
2	I liked Moses' style of lecturing and I felt that typically I understood his lectures meanwhile I really did not like Nima's style of lecturing. I think the best part of this class is when they let us have PSET partners for submissions, when that happened this class became so much more bearable. Aside from that I think this class starts off not too bad and then you hit dynamic programming and things become a lot harder than they need to be. My biggest piece of advice is try to know like 3-4 people who are also taking this class because that will really save you in the end.	CS-161
2	Good course, definitely take it	CS-161
2	"The slides and course material are good. The lecturer also teaches the course well.However, you may not expect responsible TAs in the class. Often, the questions in discussion forum can be solved in time. And the TAs make many mistaking in grading. You'd better propose exactly the same answer as the solution by going to office hour. Otherwise, it is very likely that your hw can be graded incorrectly. There is even a case that I lose credit because of ""too much"" demonstration."	CS-161
2	Great class. Can be difficult at times but take advantage of office hours and the course staff.	CS-161
2	Moses and Nima are great lecturers but the problem sets are often too hard to do own your own. Come into this class with a study group or prepare to go to office hours every week. The grading rubric is harsh and very specific so be prepared. Course policy is a bit weird since they encourage students to discuss answers during office hours.	CS-161
2	This class was way worse than any other cs class I've taken. it's incredibly disorganized in the winter, and packs way too much information in 2 lectures a week. The psets are never representative of the material in lecture, and the exams are made to be extremely difficult. Most people go to office hours to do the PSET and its not atypical to see the entirety of huang basement packed with people to get PSET answers during office hours as they're nearly impossible to come to a solution to using the information from lecture.	CS-161
2	If you're gonna take this class, be ready for extremely long and hard PSETs and insanely difficult exams. Try not to take it with Nima & Moses if you can.	CS-161
2	Tough class and required for CS. Make sure you are thorough in your answers	CS-161
2	This course is awesome and perfect in so many ways. Highly recommend it to anyone interested in fundamental algorithmic design.	CS-161
2	Find a good TA who will carry you through. Find a supportive group of people to work with. This class is very, very challenging and the psets will not be a good time. That being said, if you put in the time, you'll learn a lot! The content is actually very interesting and relevant to technical coding interviews.	CS-161
2	This is a great course for you if you want to learn basic knowledge about algorithm, and maybe decide to dig into one kind of algorithm later on, but if you want to learn it very well, you'll definitely put a lot of effort into this course.	CS-161
2	Great course for algorithms intro.	CS-161
2	This class is literally the only reason I got through 161. Avery is the most dedicated TA I've had in my 3 years studying CS at Stanford, and not only went above and beyond to provide us with help and resources but also did an amazing job supporting us as humans. I was nervous about how the 2 hour section would add to my workload for the quarter, but the time was insanely productive in helping me understand the material and apply it on the homeworks; I always looked forward to section. He was also super responsive to student feedback and was genuinely committed to tailoring his teaching to our particular class cohort. I felt like I had a community and a support group, which I really needed in 161. If you are in doubt, TAKE THIS CLASS!	CS-161
2	Avery is an amazing teacher! This was a super helpful class. I highly recommend for anyone that struggles to grasp cs concepts on the first go. Avery walks you through any conceptual issues you have and explains material in a super helpful manner!!	CS-161
2	Really great help for 161, I suggest taking it even if you think you're advanced enough because it just gives you exta resources/time spent learning/engaging with the material	CS-161
2	Definitely take the ACE Section! Think of it as a way to force yourself to spend 2 more hours per week with the 161 material with the added benefit of getting a free unit and access to much better office hours. Avery is definitely the highlight of the course! He is always super honest and helpful. This was my second time taking an ACE section with him an I am in awe of his ability to break down complex problems into simple diagrams. He is definitely the best TA at Stanford! Overall, 11/10!	CS-161
2	Avery is absolutely incredible. A great TA and so helpful! I don't know how I would be able to survive this class without his help and the 161A section. Definitely take this section. It will improve how much you get out of this class immensely!	CS-161
2	Avery is the best ACE instructor, and I wouldn't have been able to get through the class without Avery's 161A. Avery is extremely knowledgeable about all the course material. His content reviews during section were very clear and helpful in learning and understanding the material. He could answer any question about the content you throw at him. The class was extremely organized: we had access to all the slides that Avery was planning to go over during section ahead of time, and we were told which handout problems to try out on our own ahead of time before going over them in section. I always knew what to expect ahead of time.Not only is Avery is an excellent teacher, but he is also very friendly and willing to help you, constantly going out of his way to help. We had a Slack channel for our ACE class in which we could ask questions about anything that was unclear from lecture or questions about the homework. Avery was always super responsive and helpful on Slack. He would also invite us to do work with him on campus during which we could ask him questions as we worked. I don't know how he did it, but he was always available to help, and it was very appreciated. He did all of this on top of holding 2+ hours of office hours a week, which was extremely helpful for the homework. He really helped me understand the intuition behind problems. Homework problems were tough, but with Avery's help, they were approachable and understandable.He also created really helpful resources for the class, such as a handout with 75 practice problems on it in case we wanted to engage more with the material. The problems were really great practice for the homework and exams. He created a subroutine chart that contained all the algorithms that we learned in lecture, and this might have been the most helpful resource in the entire class, because we could reference the chart when doing the homework, and it was a really great study tool for the exams. As a cherry on top, Avery hosted a very helpful final review session a week before the final, during which we reviewed all of the content from the second half of the course and ate pizza and boba together. It was a great time, and I learned a lot and felt better about the upcoming exam.Avery is a gem, and he always went above and beyond to help us succeed. If you think you will struggle with the 161 material, definitely take 161A! It can only help.	CS-161
2	161 is a difficult class, but 161A is such a big help. If you have any doubt in your algorithm or proof skills, I would recommend this class. Definitely helped having this section during the quarter.	CS-161
2	ACE really helps.	CS-161
2	I love Avery. Take it.	CS-161
2	Avery is a great TA and even more a great person!	CS-161
2	Avery's office hours and section are super helpful for 161! His explanations are clear and his lecture reviews are super helpful -- would highly recommend taking ACE for anyone taking 161!	CS-161
2	This course is super interesting if you like math. Be aware that it is extremely fast paced though, so you must stay on top of your work.	MATH-51
2	Excellent introductory linear algebra course with special topics	MATH-51
2	It is difficult.	MATH-51
2	It's a fast-paced class, but if you take the time to understand the concepts, you'll honestly be fine. If you get behind, you're going to be confused and overwhelmed pretty fast. There are so many resources for this class, so make sure to use them. Textbook is super well written and aligns with the class really well, but it's at times dense and has too much unnecessary information (as any textbook does). Gene's annotated notes were a life saver. Final was way harder than the midterms, so help your future self out by doing well on the first two tests.	MATH-51
2	It is not as difficult as people make it seem. But keep up with it through the quarter and you should do great .	MATH-51
2	ItEs a tough class for sure but also one thatEs very rewarding. You go over a lot of challenging content very quickly and itEs extremely easy to fall behind given that the course builds up. That being said, as long as you stay on top of your work, youEll be fine	MATH-51
2	Make sure you start the homework as soon as possible, do not wait until the last minute.	MATH-51
2	It's hard and the pace is super fast, but it's doable as long as you dedicate the time to reading the textbook and trying to understand the material.	MATH-51
2	Difficult and very fast paced but you learn a lot. Take with Gene if possible,	MATH-51
2	Don't skip lecture.	MATH-51
2	After lecture/every week, take a little bit of time to go through your notes and the provided annotated notes. This will definitely help with understanding things conceptually through understanding the types of problems you might confront.	MATH-51
2	The course is not super challenging but if you are taking it alongside other difficult courses it can be quite stressful. The class is so fast paced that it can be difficult to keep up with the content. You can get through the class by memorizing how to solve questions instead of understanding everything conceptually. Since they are jamming both linear algebra and multivariable calculus, its difficult to maintain a thorough understanding of the content. Not a very enjoyable experience. Only take if you have to fulfill a major req.	MATH-51
2	More likely than not, you've already heard about MATH 51; it's THE Stanford math class... in a good way or a bad way? That's debatable. MATH 51 is complex as HECK, but I found it to be genuinely interesting. I'm not a big math person, nor am I the best at math (I just took the course because of my major requirement, as most people do), but I found it to be rather doable, especially if you have a group of friends who you know are going to be taking it with you. I had Gene Kim as my lecturer, and the dude is actually sooo cool. He's probably the reason that I didn't entirely hate the course. Not only is he incredibly smart and a great teacher of the content, but he has a very funny personality that adds spice to what would be just another God-awful, boring, dry math lecture. If you're reading this, odds are you're required to take the course anyways, so my advice to you is to just find a group of people on whom you can rely, and start those psets early!!!	MATH-51
2	This course is taught pretty well - it is hard but not too bad if you keep up with the problem sets and review the textbook consistently as a supplement to your learning.	MATH-51
2	Professor Jinyoung Park is THE BEST LECTURER!! If you take this class, take it with professor Park, she makes her lectures super engaging and fun and presents the materials in a way that makes sense. Gene Kims lectures are okay if you have read the material beforehand. Interesting class but definitely time consuming.	MATH-51
2	Be prepared this class is a lot of work. Be proactive with everything. DO NOT GET BEHIND	MATH-51
2	take it if necessary. hard course but worthwhile!	MATH-51
2	The course moves extremely fast, which makes it very difficult to digest concepts without additional review. Always go back over the lectures and watch 3blue1brown videos for a conceptual and visual understanding of the topics. If you put in the extra effort, the course is manageable.	MATH-51
2	This class covers A LOT OF CONTENT in very little time. You will barely grasp one concept before moving on to a new one. The tests are not reflective of material learned in class, and you must be prepared to expand your knowledge to unimaginable levels. If you are planning on taking this class, I would highly recommend having no other difficult classes at the same time.	MATH-51
2	Ensure you read the text before class even if itEs optional. YouEll probably feel very confused and defeated many times during the class but you have to put in the extra effort on your own to going over notes and understanding. You learn a lot from doing the homework	MATH-51
2	Mark teaches this class very well, would definitely recommend reading every single assigned chapter before the class so that you don't fall behind.	MATH-51
2	I definitely think that this is a must for Stanford students. As challenging as the coursework is, I definitely found some enjoyable elements in both the content as well as the instructors themselves.	MATH-51
2	This class is hard, but extremely rewarding if you put in time. Take it with Gene if you can. I literally learned so much in this class in such a short period of time. Math 51 opens yourself to so many opportunities/applications in so many fields.	MATH-51
2	it's a difficult course, but if you go to lecture & do the psets you should be fine	MATH-51
2	Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this course, for lectures, psets, and supplemental studying.	MATH-51
2	I had no prior knowledge on any of the course content and thought the course went at the perfect pace! I HIGHLY suggest reading the entire textbook chapter (Except the extra portions), and not just the required readings. I also highly recommend watching the 3blue1brown videos: The Essence of Linear Algebra mentioned in the textbook. The last 3rd of the course, I stopped going to lecture because I found it relatively useless since most of the problems for lectures were pulled from the textbook. Instead, I'd just read the textbook, review the lecture notes, and get practice working out the problems through the homework. I found this course to be 100x more manageable than math 21. Although Gene's lectures can be funny, I don't think his lectures live up to the hype. I had Nate Dowlin for math 21, and I feel he is a better teacher than Gene. So if you have the choice, take it with Nate.	MATH-51
2	This class is terrible E for everyone. I thought I would be fine because I had already taken MultiV, but I must have been delusional.	MATH-51
2	This course is definitely a challenge, but if you are willing to devote the time it requires to understand the material, it is ultimately very rewarding.	MATH-51
2	Definitely has a reputation at Stanford, but it is within reach! Definitely make use of all the resources that are there to help you (section, office hours, SUMO, etc.) Very interesting material that has tangible real-world applications.	MATH-51
2	A challenging but rewarding course. It was really well taught.	MATH-51
2	hard and comes at you fast but interesting content and very organized. Be careful that a lot of people have prior knowledge	MATH-51
2	It's a pretty good course, we learned a lot at a reasonable pace. I will say I relied a lot on YouTube to develop the intuition needed to understand some of the material, since the course was pretty focused on problem-solving but didn't spend that much time on conceptual understanding.	MATH-51
2	This is a very fast-paced class. There also is a lot of reading to do in every class.	MATH-51
2	It's really hard, put in work	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a well-organized course with a great learning plan that allows you to expand on the past topics you have learned and continue growing your understanding of an idea. I like how everything seemed to connect in some way, from vectors to column spaces to orthogonal bases. Overall, this was a really interesting course!	MATH-51
2	Great class, Gene Kim is a great instructor. (Gene please give me an A on the final)	MATH-51
2	Go to all of the lectures and do the psets ahead of time so you can attend office hours.	MATH-51
2	I think overall, the course is very well taught. Gene Kim does an excellent job of explaining in lecture, and includes plenty of examples to help reinforce the theoretical understanding. Be warned, however, that they are absurdly rigid in their unwillingness to help students. I got covid about a week and a half before the midterm (along with the 2000 other students who got covid this quarter), and they were very clear that no Zoom would be offered, regardless of covid positivity. This is probably more of a department problem than the actual course, but it did severely affect my ability to learn while I had covid.	MATH-51
2	The class is taught well, the textbook is helpful. However, it moves very very fast. Gene Kim is excellent	MATH-51
2	This course moves pretty fast. it is very well organized but if you haven't done the content before it can feel like drinking out of a firehose. Be prepared to put the time in and ask lots of questions.	MATH-51
2	Be prepared to work hard but itEs not as bad as itEs hyped up to be. Also take genes lecture if you can heEs awesome.	MATH-51
2	very hard and time consuming. get on top of work early and prepare to spend a lot of time on it in order to do well	MATH-51
2	This class is difficult. Requires a lot of time for psets and studying. Reading the textbook is really useful - exams sometimes will cover topics very briefly mentioned in class. Watch supplemental videos in addition to class if linear algebra/multi is new to you or you need extra support.	MATH-51
2	Put in the work and do your PCRQs.  It's def not that bad as most people would like to make it out to be.	MATH-51
2	Class is conceptually heavy and important for you to not fall behind. Saying this, do the readings, the homework, discussions, and complete lecture notes. Although it sounds heavy, it's very doable.	MATH-51
2	You will learn a great deal. But be prepared, it is going to be a lot of work.	MATH-51
2	This course is structured beautifully. The grade you get seems to be directly correlated with how much work you put into the course. That being said, it will be harder for some than others, and the content isn't necessarily easy. I don't recommend skipping math 21 if you're supposed to take that course.	MATH-51
2	Jinyoung Park explains concepts very clearly but very fast. She goes over the section in the book in her lecture worksheet, which is very helpful if you learn well after a professor discusses a concept quickly and then does many examples.	MATH-51
2	After taking 21, 51 was not bad at all. The lesson notes and textbooks are well organized and easy to follow. I even enjoyed the class slightly!	MATH-51
2	It is a lot of work, goes really quickly. Try to not fall behind or studying for the midterms is going to be tough	MATH-51
2	If you are only taking this course because it is a pre-req, beware! It is very difficult and if you are not naturally inclined to be good at math you are going to have to put a lot of work into it. While it is unavoidable for many majors, I'd suggest taking a lighter course load while you take this class.	MATH-51
2	Hard class but worth taking, super applicable and useful maths	MATH-51
2	Highly recommend this class to everyone. The understanding of linear algebra you will gain will have applicable across majors. The course is extremely well organized and very manageable if you take it the way it's designed.	MATH-51
2	It's very well structured, but from my experience vs others, I think it's worth taking in Winter or at least after going through MATH 21 if you need it	MATH-51
2	To be completely honest, this class is hard. I have had no experience with linear algebra or multivariable calculus before. When taking the class, I feel like everyone else around me already learned everything or learned at least 1 topic that was discussed. The material was entirely new to me, so I struggled so much. I recommend going to discussion or at least doing the worksheets. Also, make sure you understand the psets. Expect to struggle a bit more on the midterm than the psets. I also recommend taking it in the spring or with a schedule where you can actually focus on this class if you are new to the topics.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a really challenging course. The instruction is fantastic, but often instructors have to lecture quickly due to the hour long lecture times. Sections are somewhat helpful, but I highly recommend going to office hours. Start your PSETs early and take the class with your friends. It takes a village to get through 51!	MATH-51
2	Only take it if you are in a good mental head space and you have loads of time.	MATH-51
2	The weekly psets can be somewhat time-consuming, so try to start them early.	MATH-51
2	This course is SO much better than Math 21 - easier too, IMO. Jinyoung is the BEST. PLEASE take this class with her if you can - she is super engaging, funny, and down-to-earth; she also is very open to student questions, and is always available to help. Honestly I really enjoyed this class - as long as you keep up with the material (it is fast-paced) you will learn a lot.	MATH-51
2	This class is hard. Understand that a lot of the people who take this class have already taken similar classes in high school so do not be discouraged if you don't do as well as you may be used to. It's a hard class and it covers a lot of content in a very short amount of time (a chapter a day). Take CME 100 instead if your major allows. That being said, the instructors are super awesome, it's just hard content.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is definitely doable, but it will take a lot of commitment. Start the homeworks early and find an effective study partner / group.	MATH-51
2	Excellent course.	MATH-51
2	Great if you can vizualise geometry well	MATH-51
2	Overall definitely a must-take for stronger clarity of concepts in mathematics and its applications in other correlated fields, particularly CS.	MATH-51
2	it was very difficult, but i think i learned a lot. I wish my effort paid off though because i felt like i put so much effort into this class and it didn't show up in my scores.	MATH-51
2	This class is very hard. There is a ton of content squeezed into 10 weeks and definitely not enough time to cover all of it. Because it moves so quickly, it is hard to really understand and digest topics because very little time is spent on each one. As a result, the class was quite overwhelming as I always felt like I was playing catch-up. I understand that this course is a requirement for many majors - and some the content actually is quite interesting - but overall it was a very stressful experience due to the structure and pace of the course. The problem sets and exams were very difficult as well. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are super passionate about math and/or need it for a major requirement. That being said, Jinyoung Park is a great instructor. She is funny, kind, explains concepts well, and is very receptive to questions. She definitely made the class better.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a great course.  It is high speed, so it is important to stay up to date, but I gained a lot of great problem-solving skills.	MATH-51
2	JINYOUNG PARK IS THE BEST!!! She is so good at explaining examples and caring for her students. Math 51 is a lot of work, but if you keep up, it'll be fine.	MATH-51
2	If you are interested in multivariable calculus and linear algebra, this is a great class to take. if you are not interested and do not have to take it, don't. It is a really quick course, so if you do not have time to catch up with the fast pace, you will not be okay.	MATH-51
2	This class is a requirement for most majors, therefore it is reasonable and pretty much what you would expect. Not very fun,	MATH-51
2	honestly, do it. will it be hard? no doubt. but jinyoung is such a good teacher, no matter how difficult the content is, youEll always be able to walk out of class with a smile. study hard, use office hours, find a pset group, and go all out in this course to succeed. the payoff will be priceless	MATH-51
2	Which prof you get really matters, which is very unfair	MATH-51
2	Definitely take the course if you have a strong STEM background and want to continue your STEM studies. I would say the organization of the class could be better, especially in that a lot of material is covered in the last 2 weeks compared to the first 8, which increases stress toward finals week in my opinion. I do think the quality of instruction is great however - Prof. Jinyoung is fantastic!	MATH-51
2	hard. go to class. don't skip section. jinyoung park is great and casually hilarious <3	MATH-51
2	Make sure to read the textbook before attending lecture. If you aren't following along in class there's point of you being there. Review your lesson right after lecture.	MATH-51
2	This course is hard make sure you have time to learn the material. The midterm and final are both very hard	MATH-51
2	This class is definitely tough, but doable if you put in the effort. However, the math department isn't really flexible even with those who were exposed to COVID.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is dummy hard for a smooth brain boy like me. I really struggled with the class and the workload. The homeworks are way too long.	MATH-51
2	This is a challenging course but an essential one to take.	MATH-51
2	Do the textbook reading and make sure you understand the concepts after each and every lecture because the content moves very fast. Also work through the homework early and as you go because doing problems will help you understand the book to a greater extent.	MATH-51
2	Watch 3Blue1Brown!!!!	MATH-51
2	If you put the work in and don't get behind on understanding lecture concepts, this course is definitely doable. Make sure to do the psets for the problems from lecture after the lecture where they are taught.	MATH-51
2	Hard, but not unreasonable. Don't skip lecture. Go to a good section leader so you can ask questions.	MATH-51
2	A good class with interesting applications. It is very fast paced, so don't get too behind and start the P-sets relatively early.	MATH-51
2	Difficult course that moves very quickly. Utilize office hours.	MATH-51
2	It is kind of rough, but so necessary to take so many future classes. The class would be manageable if it moved slower because you can't really afford to get behind for more than 1 lecture. Reading the textbook is key in this course and personally, I really benefited from actually going to all lectures and sections.	MATH-51
2	Attend office hours, go to lecture, and prepare for the problem sets because they take longer than you think.	MATH-51
2	The course is gonna suck no matter how you take it. Honestly, the concepts covered in class are actually very interesting and the textbook tries its best to make connections with applications in other majors and real world. But the amount of material covered in this curriculum is insane. The math department would honestly resolve so many issues from Math 51 if they separated Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calc or just slowed the pace of this course down one way or another. If you're taking this course, I would definitely study the first few chapters ahead of time because Linear Algebra is essentially a whole new language/way of doing math.  Lucianovic is like the epitome of your typical University math professor, he uses chalkboard to lecture and is very theoretical in his lectures. His lecture style was awesome at first, until I realized how hard it was to do problem sets and do well on the exams without having many examples done in class. I really wished he would use an iPad like other professors so he would waste less time just writing out the problems on the board. He almost always ran out of time during lectures to cover meaningful examples, which is damaging considering how difficult each chapter and psets are. If it wasn't for professor Gene Kim's annotated notes I would not have gotten through the course. I often found myself having to relearn the chapters using uploaded lectures notes and the textbook. If professor Lucianovic just adapted the iPad teaching style and did more examples, I think he would have been my favorite lecturer. Professor Park in my opinion had the best teaching balance this quarter, explaining concepts in detail then doing enough examples in class. Professor Kim's lectures felt like he did way too many examples and too little of explaining, but gotta thank him for his annotated notes with examples.	MATH-51
2	I think this class would be much better if the content was divided into two quarters. The class in my opinion is actually well taught; it's just that there is too much content so it goes by really fast. The professors and TAs are also quite unforgiving. All in all, the more time you spend on the course, the better you'll do.	MATH-51
2	Don't shy away from Math 51 - I've learned more than I have in any math class and gained a much deeper appreciation for the subject. If you can stay on top of content (take notes on every pre reading, complete all discussion worksheets, understand the homework), which is not an easy task, you will get a good grade. That said, a strong foundation in math, particularly with math without a calculator, is crucial. Math 21 material isn't as relevant, but Calc (derivatives), Algebra II (comfort with factoring large polynomials) and PreCalc (hyperbolas, ellipses, trig) comes in handy a lot. The only thing that I think is slightly unfair about the class is that I almost ran out of time on every midterm / final.	MATH-51
2	This course is intense but well taught. I would recommend going to all lectures, discussion sections, and starting problem sets early.	MATH-51
2	The textbook is the best math textbook I've ever used	MATH-51
2	Make sure to go to section as section problems help on the homework and tests.	MATH-51
2	Be ready for this class. It will not be easy to understand the material right from the textbook or the lectures. Stay up to date, go to the numerous office hours and SUMO tutoring sessions for help. Do PSETs with your friends and make sure to do them early. Start the weekend before or better yet do the chapter's problems right after the lecture. The content itself isn't difficult, but it will take time and help from others to master!	MATH-51
2	Took the class for the first few weeks of fall quarter but decided to drop and take it in the winter. It was pretty doable just a lot of time needed for psets and studying as a lot of it is cumulative and you need to have good foundational skills.	MATH-51
2	This is a very difficult course, and if you do not understand the material, you may get left behind even if you try to engage in the many resources the course offers.	MATH-51
2	Great class to take, but the tests are unforgiving.	MATH-51
2	Take it with Gene! Overall, it was very well taught. Be prepared though--the first exam was easy, then the second one was harder, and then the final was crazy hard.	MATH-51
2	Very interesting! I will say I'm more of a math nerd, but thought that it was very well taught and helped apply difficult concepts to each other and outside of math.	MATH-51
2	It's really difficult, and if you dislike math it's going to be a real challenge. However, stay on top of readings and use your resources and you should be OK.	MATH-51
2	This is a great course, but it moves too quickly for us to truly understand what is happening. The material seems relevant, but I wouldn't really know; we blew past a year's worth of material in ten weeks to the point where I don't really understand what happened this quarter.	MATH-51
2	Very difficult, overwhelming, go to office hours.	MATH-51
2	some people find this class extremely difficult. i was one of those people. don't expect a lot of content overlap between this and calc bc. it is entirely new content. if you have the skills and determination to succeed in this class, it is possible to do so, but be prepared to really work for it and put in a lot of time on your own outside of class because you will undoubtedly find the instruction somewhat lacking.	MATH-51
2	"This is a class that promotes ""active learning"", which means you cannot rely on learning everything in class. It is normal to open a problem set and realize you need to relearn it to approach the problems. In the end, I didn't even go to class, since I need to do the learning myself regardless. Class is very dense, but you can do it if you are committed."	MATH-51
2	This has easily been the best math class I have taken at Stanford. Any chance you have to take a math class with Mark Lucianovic instead of another professor, TAKE IT. He's phenomenal. (If you're picking between CME 100 and Math 51, pick 51!)	MATH-51
2	Incredibly fast paced and difficult, but the teaching staff is excellent and the textbook is incredibly well written.	MATH-51
2	Although the PSETs may seem impossible at first, the process of figuring it out was the best way that I learned the concepts of this course.	MATH-51
2	Class goes by very fast and there's not much time to slack off, so make sure you keep this in mind when signing up for the course.	MATH-51
2	This is a great course that you will almost certainly have to take.	MATH-51
2	Take it! This course is extremely organized! I would also recommend reading the textbook. You can get a much deeper intuition of concepts from reading the textbook. In particular, reading the textbook before going to lecture will allow you to make the most out of lecture, which acts more like a review of the important concepts of the textbook.	MATH-51
2	Stay on top of assignments. Read the book if youEre confused and go to office hours	MATH-51
2	The class moves quite fast so it's important to stay on top of new concepts. Also, professors all have unique strengths. In my experience, prof Mark Lucianovic teaches very conceptually and explains why everything works the way it does. Gene Kim focuses more on examples.	MATH-51
2	You will learn a lot at a fast pace.	MATH-51
2	It's a very fast paced course where you are constantly new material, make sure to review notes every week to ensure you understand all the concepts	MATH-51
2	See what other classes can allow to meet major requirements	MATH-51
2	It is a tough course but as long as you go to section and office hours it is quite manageable.	MATH-51
2	This course is difficult without a good basis for linear algebra concepts. Highly recommend for taking it regardless, since it includes concepts that are useful for many majors (esp. STEM related). Utilizing office hours and external resources (for visualization) definitely help.	MATH-51
2	Interesting material, but leaves certain gaps in understanding. Try to read the proofs given in the textbook for the results that are assumed to be true in the course.	MATH-51
2	Mark is a great lecturer and explained concepts very well. The course was extremely organized, and the problem sets aligned closely with what was covered on the exams.	MATH-51
2	The content is difficult, but the course is organized so that you're able to learn it effectively.	MATH-51
2	Start the PSETs early and make sure you go to discussion section. It is the best time to just ask questions and solidify your understanding.	MATH-51
2	Theoretically, the course content is not that hard. However, the textbook/lectures can make the content a little confusing, so ask questions! Every lecture also goes overtime, so keep that in mind when scheduling other classes. I highly recommend finding a good section leader who will reteach lecture content in section. Lastly, if you have to isolate for any reason, it is important to know that lectures are not recorded and they will not Zoom you in. It's up to you to learn the material on your own if you miss lecture/section!	MATH-51
2	1.) Go to class. Go to discussion. Go to office hours. There is plenty of help if you need it, but you have to show up and ask for it.2.) You will learn best by doing lots and lots of practice problems. Use the textbook, lecture worksheets, Khan Academy, ANYTHING. But you will only get out as much as you put in.3.) Class builds quite heavily on itself, so PAY ATTENTION during the early weeks of the quarter.4) Use CTL tutoring, they are AMAZING!	MATH-51
2	Do the readings before class and go to section!	MATH-51
2	Really enjoyed the class!! What helped me get through the course: reading and solving textbook chapter examples, talking about topics to check that I really understand the intuition behind the processes, and actually doing homework problems myself before checking with others. I also was enrolled in Mark Lucianovic 's lectures which I enjoyed going to. I found that he explained the concepts in a very accessible way because he always made sure to build up to the new information by reviewing old information and by telling us what the big picture was to give motivation for why we were doing certain things. Overall, I am very glad I took this class.	MATH-51
2	I would definitely recommend it especially if you are looking into cs or econ	MATH-51
2	Go to lecture, but also the textbook can often give you all the answers you're looking for if you're not too comfortable with any topic.	MATH-51
2	I would recommend to take advantage of office hours and review sessions but also to read the textbook as it is written very well.	MATH-51
2	The course is well-structured for what it is. There is a lot of content, and you are going to have to put a lot of work in. That being said, if you put the work in, it is certainly manageable.	MATH-51
2	Not the best class, but also not terrible. The content itself is interesting and cool, but the way you are forced to do certain things their way is what takes from this class.	MATH-51
2	Learning the course material ahead of time is very beneficial because although the material is understandable, the course moves very quickly, so knowing things ahead definitely helps with comprehension.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 was a really hard class for me.  I worked really hard towards the end though and went to a bunch of office hours and I feel as if that really improved my understanding and performance on the final.  It's quite doable and interesting but requires some effort for sure.	MATH-51
2	It was a difficult course that fulfilled a requirement.	MATH-51
2	This is by far the most difficult class that I have taken at Stanford. Mark was extremely nice and taught fairly well, but just be ready to have to teach yourself a lot of the material. Class just really isn't long enough to teach students how to do problems in depth, so most of the time I was struggling a lot to understand homework. Exams were also horrible. No homework or review I felt prepared me well for any of them.	MATH-51
2	It's Math 51. Not much left to add to what's already been said. Although it's an unpopular ranking, I would rank the lecturers in the following order: Mark>Jinyoung>Gene. Mark explains the concepts and intuition behind what we're learning a lot better than the other two lecturers. Jinyoung goes through examples in the clearest way and she is great at answering questions and overall being really supportive. Gene goes through a ton of examples in lecture and he wrote the exams in my quarter so he would give some insights that the other profs wouldn't. He was also the only lecturer that would post their annotated notes; he's a legend for that. Overall the course covers so much content and I struggled finding motivation to finish all the psets but the linear algebra is interesting and satisfying when you understand it. It's part of the stanford experience, don't hesitate to take it. Just get it over with.	MATH-51
2	this is the most fast paced course you could possibly take. office hours are a must, and quality of instruction and content varies by instructor.	MATH-51
2	This class is a fun class	MATH-51
2	Start p-sets and assignments early.	MATH-51
2	Don't take it for fun. Understand that it's a different class than anything you've taken before. DO NOT FALL BEHIND. Lectures stopped being helpful halfway through but sections were so helpful throughout	MATH-51
2	Ur mum	MATH-51
2	Goodluck	MATH-51
2	This course isn't as hard as everyone makes it out to be!	MATH-51
2	Take this course with a lighter course load, as it will require a lot of out-of-class time to feel confident in the material. Attend every lecture if you can. It'll be a tough class, but you can do it.	MATH-51
2	Not all sections are very useful, but i recommend doing the worksheets and practice tests.	MATH-51
2	This is a very fast-paced course, but it is extremely organised and well-taught. Pre-readings are a questionnaire are required before each class and I found they really helped to prime my mind before class, given the weight of new material. Exams were somewhat challenging but I felt well-prepared given the instruction. Section is also a helpful resource, and there are video solutions provided for section which you can go over afterwards. Overall, a very good course.	MATH-51
2	It is the hardest course I have ever taken. I tried my best and worked so hard, but it took a toll on my mental health and confidence as a student.	MATH-51
2	How much you enjoy the course is largely based on your own preferences, but I personally found it very interesting. All the lecturers I attended (Gene, Mark, Jinyoung) were excellent. Read the textbook!	MATH-51
2	This is a good class. Have fun!	MATH-51
2	Too much info jammed into one quarter!	MATH-51
2	Take it! Super pivotal to any field in the future	MATH-51
2	This is a very fast pace course but the instructors are good and there are many resources to help you.	MATH-51
2	No	MATH-51
2	This course is very very intense and you must have the time for it. If you do not have a solid background in single variable calculus, then the concepts will be difficult to grasp. Would suggest not taking this class with a bulky schedule, as I dedicated the majority of my outside of school hours to catching up on Math 51.	MATH-51
2	I think we spent too much time on the basics, but then again people are coming from different backgrounds. Did not like the homework because it was very computation heavy, and there'd be several problems of the exact same type given to us. Overall a good and manageable course as advertised, learnt very helpful linear algebra. Read section worksheet solutions; those are most helpful when it comes to reviewnig for exams.	MATH-51
2	It does actually teach useful math.	MATH-51
2	I guess take it. It's a hard course, but if you put in the time and do a lot of practice questions you should be fine. Attending lecture is really important too.	MATH-51
2	This class is challenging but doable. Stay on top of work and read the text book.	MATH-51
2	Hard class but definitely organized in a way that will let you catch up/stay on track if you try. Start problem sets early!	MATH-51
2	It's a lot of work and moves really fast - don't fall behind!	MATH-51
2	I really did like the way the book was written and the way Gene Kim (my professor) interacted with students and made topics accessible to us.	MATH-51
2	Gene Kim is an exceptional lecturer. Gene's teaching is the leading reason behind my success in this course, so if possible, take it with Gene. I imagine that the other instructors are excellent as well, but Gene is a guarantee for an incredible class. Go to every section as well; the discussions are incredibly helpful and they help to solidify concepts learned in lecture. Space out your PSET so as to not be swamped, and study well for the midterms and the final. Take advantage of your notes sheet!	MATH-51
2	It's a ton of content, but super interesting stuff. Make sure to start the problem sets early, as the pacing will make more sense with the lectures and you'll have more room to study for midterms.	MATH-51
2	The content in this class is extremely useful. However, it is quite challenging and you may find yourself spending hours a week studying only to scrape by on each exam.	MATH-51
2	This course is extremely fast paced. We covered about a chapter a lecture and sometimes 2 chapters. The tests are very challenging and even if you feel like you understand the concepts that doesn't mean you'll be able to answer the questions.	MATH-51
2	The material builds on itself in a way that is both satisfying and manageable. At no point did I feel like the content was moving at an unreasonable pace	MATH-51
2	THIS CLASS IS HORRIBLY TAUGHT. THEY TEACH NOTHING IN LECTURES. YOU LEARN EVERYTHING BY READING THE TEXTBOOK. Don't waste your time by going to lectures. Just read the textbook.	MATH-51
2	Do not take this with any other class that will take time that you're planning on enjoying and understanding. You will spend all of your time thinking about how much you hate this class, and when you're not doing that, you will be hating yourself because you're doing the PSET. I was very nearly reverse weeded into humanities because of this class, and if I don't get a passing grade I might just do that!The textbook also is so esoteric and unapproachable it's hilarious. If you have to have a guide on the website about how to read your textbook, you're doing the textbook wrong. Band together with a group of students in your dorm or just from the class where you can discuss stuff on the PCRQ's because that will be infinitely more time efficient and prep you for lecture more than trudging through the textbook by yourself.And DEAR GOD GO TO OFFICE HOURS. You need every resource you can get, and even sometimes the TA's struggle with the course material. You can do it. You've got this. It's gonna be a long 10 weeks, but you've got this.	MATH-51
2	This class was hard, but if you grind it is more manageable. It is also easy to let other people take the lead on homework assignments, but you should try your best to do things individually (at least for your first attempt), it'll save you the headache of re-learning stuff later.	MATH-51
2	Difficult class but had to do it for a major requirement	MATH-51
2	A lot of work, a lot of reading, keep up with class because then it becomes 10 times harder.	MATH-51
2	"TAKE IT WITH GENE KIM. I'm so serious. When he says he is the ""Math 51 Whisperer"" he means it. I really enjoyed this class. Do the psets by yourself and then pay attention in class and you will be so fine."	MATH-51
2	This class is extremely intense and would recommend to those who feel extremely prepared for higher-level mathematical concepts. The class also assumes students know some of the content prior to exams.	MATH-51
2	This class is tough and a lot of work, but there are a fair amount of resources to help you through it.	MATH-51
2	Gene Kim was an amazing instructor. He was funny, clearly communicated and explained concepts, was very supportive of questions, and gave great applications to topics discussed in class. Would highly recommend him :)	MATH-51
2	This is a tough course but manageable with an optimized teaching staff. Because of the volume of students and thus large teaching staff, there is a lot of flexibility in which teachers you choose to engage with more. If possible, attend different lecturers and sections to talk to other students to see which teaching style best suits you. From my experience with Gene, he was the best lecturer. Even though he zooms through material in lecture and I often left very lost, lectures were engaging and entertaining and also the annotated notes are very easy to follow, especially having attended lecture. He does a great job with providing challenging examples and extensions for learning beyond class. He also makes the exams and his notes are most representative of it compared to others.	MATH-51
2	This goes without saying but do not take this course unless it is required for your major or unless you actually like math (although this course may change your mind on the latter, and if you're unsure of your major and MATH 51 only *might* be a prereq for one of the required classes, better to put it off). Way too much content crammed into ten weeks--the one-hour lectures are never enough time to even cover half of the example problems Gene puts in his notes. The majority of the learning happens outside of lecture--I got the most out of reading the textbook, but studying looks different for everyone. And as confused as I was this quarter, what makes the least sense to me is the fact that the course administrators/instructors refused to record lectures or allow COVID-positive students to Zoom into lectures.	MATH-51
2	This is a great class. Truly satisfying at the end.	MATH-51
2	Hard class, don't procrastinate	MATH-51
2	This course is hard! It is definitely the hardest class I've taken at Stanford, especially as someone with no experience in multivariable calculus or linear algebra. The course moves extremely fast. By the time you start to understand a concept, the class has already moved on to the next two chapters. I would recommend that you do not take this class at the same time as any other difficult courses, as Math 51 requires a large time commitment and my hinder your abilities to study for other courses.	MATH-51
2	Stay on top of the homework and go to lecture -- make use of the textbook, and all of the lecture notes that are posted	MATH-51
2	I would take a light quarter when taking this course because it requires a ton of self initiative and self discipline to do well in this course.	MATH-51
2	Take it! It is a very enjoyable course if you put the work in.	MATH-51
2	MATH 51 is MATH 51 -- the beginning of the course was very confusing, the second part was understandable, and the end expanded greatly on previous knowledge. The teaching quality is okay, but zero accommodations were made for me when I tested positive for COVID. The lectures aren't recorded, but the annotated notes usually suffice. However, be aware that many of the annotated notes have typos and wrong math in them.	MATH-51
2	Make sure you work very hard.	MATH-51
2	Take it with Gene! He is honestly a legend and will give you all of the tools you need to succeed in this class. Math 51 is structured pretty well, and if you do the readings and the extra practice problems that they give (highly recommend this) then you will be extremely well prepared for everything in this course.	MATH-51
2	Do not take 51 unless you really need to. There is so much material packed into the 10 weeks, and it is a nonstop sprint to the end. The textbook is very confusing and the way in which the class in laid out is hard to navigate. Nonetheless, Gene Kim is an amazing lecturer, and he really cares about his students, but his humor is a little bit at the expense of some students.	MATH-51
2	You will be fine as long as you stay on top of the material and make sure you truly understand it following every lecture.	MATH-51
2	For this class the homework is very similar to the exams so try to work through the homework and understand what you are doing.	MATH-51
2	Make sure not to fall behind on material covered in class.	MATH-51
2	Gene Kim was a good lecturer. Interesting class with wide-applications.	MATH-51
2	This class was very difficult but I learned a lot about matrices!	MATH-51
2	I honestly enjoyed the course, but it can be difficult for less mathematically-inclined students since it progresses very fast. Gene is a fantastic (and entertaining) lecturer, and his office hours are great :)	MATH-51
2	Take it with Gene! He has a great sense of humor, is super friendly and approachable, and has super useful lecture notes!	MATH-51
2	The course goes extremely fast, you should do problem sets and discussion problems. Also attend all lectures and discussion sections. I recommend improve your conceptual thinking about the concepts before applying your knowledge to problems since they do not teach conceptually in the class.	MATH-51
2	could have been manageable with the right support. But, to be honest, the math department conducted themselves very poorly, which in turn, reflects badly on stanford as an institution. there were no accommodations for students in isolation due to covid (no recorded lectures, no hybrid option, and being facetimed in by a friend was prohibited), which is absolutely unconscionable when there's a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and honestly, it's an accessibility lawsuit waiting to happen. many students experienced this throughout the quarter in this class, but it was a trend in other math classes as well. academic advisors were not helpful as they could not do anything since the math department did not violate any specific policy, which is a flimsy excuse on the math department's behalf. if certain policies allow this type behavior, perhaps it points to a larger problem with policies that stanford should address immediately.	MATH-51
2	While the class is challenging especially in the last third of the course or so, the workload is very manageable and gaining a deep understanding of concepts is very doable if you go to office hours and/or SUMO. To save yourself stress, definitely start the homework early and split up the work over several days. Try your best to not miss any lectures (they are not recorded) and although section is not mandatory, make sure to go to all of those as well. ACE section in particular was super helpful in helping me understand the course material.	MATH-51
2	Fairly well-taught course. I recommend trying different lecturers if you can and seeing which best fits your learning style. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ACE SECTION. If you're not in ACE, just try to do some of the discussion problems before going to section as this helps you essentially study for the exams and practice different types of problems throughout the quarter rather than right before the tests. Having a pset partner/group is very helpful.	MATH-51
2	I personally loved this course because I'm a math fanatic, but do be prepared for the course pacing to move insanely fast after week 3. Don't do PSETs alone and try to work in groups. Study early for midterms and pay special attention to how the concepts work abstractly.	MATH-51
2	I suggest you only take this course if it is absolutely necessary. Don't take this for fun. :)	MATH-51
2	- It is very organized with a lot of office hours and additional resources which is useful - There is a lot of assignments eg PCQs, homework etc - Make sure you do not get too behind and if you don't understand try to as things build up- Find a group of people taking it also that can support you, can do work through homework with etc as it makes the course a lot more enjoyable- it moves very quick Very organized but very quick. Final is very conceptually hard.	MATH-51
2	Remember to read the textbook to conceptually understand this class since most topics are hard to grasp by just going to lecture alone. Definitely use the office hours offered as a supplement to your PSET understanding	MATH-51
2	please take this if you are questioning how well you will do in Math 51, it is incredibly helpful	MATH-51
2	Learn to use outside resources, kahn academy, etc. The teachers are pretty good but the class moves so fast that if you are not solid on one topic while its being taught in class/ going over it in discussion, the class will move on anyways and not mention the topic again. It will only come up later on a midterm/final.	MATH-51
2	Its a class for independent study.	MATH-51
2	Really difficult class, DO NOT TAKE WITH PHYSICS. A killer combination unless you're on top of your game or have seen either material before.	MATH-51
2	I love Prof Jinyoung Park!! You know she cares about her students and cares that everyone understands the materials. She's also very funny and very easy to approach, so she made Math 51 not so bad. Also, go to discussion sections! I found them very very helpful. Even though the content does ramp up in the middle, the discussion sections help you understand so much better.	MATH-51
2	If you're considering taking this course, you probably need it. Just take it -- go to every lecture and try to do as much of the psets by yourself, they really really help your understanding.	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is set up pretty well from a teaching standpoint. It's taught by a few different people. Jinyoung Park is an excellent lecturer - she talks pretty quickly but her teaching is very thorough. All attendance is optional. The math department as a whole is really bad with virtual accommodation - it is never streamed/recorded/etc, no matter what. The department is also super strict on late work, they don't accept any at all. Even though you don't have to go to section, doing the worksheets at least can be really useful practice, and the TAs are good at helping students understand the material.	MATH-51
2	Very difficult class.	MATH-51
2	This course is demanding, but overall fair. Take it if you have to and maybe also if you want to.	MATH-51
2	Make linear algebra more confusing than is necessary by combining with multivariable calculus. Simpler ways to solve problems are not covered (like cross product) in favor of more rigerous and generally applicable methods	MATH-51
2	If you like STEM, not as bad as what people play it out to be. Beware of the midterms & finals: the provided practice is easier than the real tests.	MATH-51
2	It is hard especially the second midterm) but it will be ok.	MATH-51
2	Challenging but very rewarding class! Will learn alot! Go to Jinyoung's lecture!!!!	MATH-51
2	I am so sorry.	MATH-51
2	Start studying for the tests at least 3 days in advance, take advantage of TA and professor office hours	MATH-51
2	Honestly, take this class with people that you know so you have a lot of support as it gets difficult. The instruction is generally not helpful and the textbook is even worse. Spend your time looking through YouTube and Office Hours because there is no other way to even pass without reaching out for help.	MATH-51
2	As someone not confident in math, this class felt like 8 units. Also donEt get behind. Ever.	MATH-51
2	Very very very difficult	MATH-51
2	This is an absolutely perfect course. I think it is brilliantly taught and has some of the most passionate lecturers and section leaders I have ever seen. It is undoubtedly difficult, easily the most difficult course I have taken at Stanford. That being said, the class is worth it as you will learn the power of working through problems and feel the satisfaction of grasping tough concepts. Tough class, but well worth it.	MATH-51
2	I learned a ton about linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and general math skills form this course. While it is a lot of work, the course is very useful for everything that uses some of linear algebra.	MATH-51
2	Keep up with the pace of this class and you will be fine! Hard work but definitely doable.	MATH-51
2	It's a huge time commitment. You'll learn a lot but it's necessary to be very proactive about your learning. Know how to prepare well for the exams -- it's important.	MATH-51
2	Jinyoung Park was an amazing lecturer she is funny and to the point and knows what she is doing. I believe she was a new instructor this quarter, but if you have the opportunity to take the class with her I highly recommend. Noah Cohan is also probably the best TA ever just generally.	MATH-51
2	This is one of the most well-organized and best-taught courses at Stanford. Stay on top of the readings and you will learn a ton.	MATH-51
2	Excruciating but mandatory for basically all STEM/Social Sciences. Get it over with ASAP.	MATH-51
2	I think that's it's important to keep in mind, you are going to get an output based on the effort that you put into this class. That means, that if you are looking to succeed, there are enough avenues that will help you get there. Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that a large majority of the grade for this class is either midterms or the final, but make sure that you are focusing in on the homework and are able to understand the things that you are doing in it.	MATH-51
2	Its hard but its fair for the most part. The exams are a bit tricky.	MATH-51
2	If the Math Placement Diagnostic test didn't place you in MATH 51, DO NOT TAKE MATH 51. This course is FAST PACED and single variable calc topics will NOT BE REVIEWED in depth. When you take this course, it is assumed that you are well-versed in single-variable calc. You should take whatever course the diagnostic recommends. However, if you, like me, think you're super smart and want to ignore the recommendation of the diagnostic, then at least DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH PROFESSOR PARK. She is very new. I believe this was her first quarter instructing this course. She is not good at explaining things. She skips over crucial pieces of the explanation, leaving you to to fill in all the gaps. One time I sat through her hour-long lecture on contour plots and left the lecture still not getting it. Later that day I found a 6 minute YouTube video on contour plots and completely understood the concept. TLDR; you should not ignore the Math Placement Diagnostic if it doesn't place you in MATH 51. If you do ignore the diagnostic, then take MATH 51 with a professor other than Park.	MATH-51
2	Make sure to stay ahead in lecture, it can get easy to fall behind. Also try to develop good study habits, thereEs a variety of resources available but a lot only work for certain types of people (such as the textbook - very dense and hard for some people to follow along)	MATH-51
2	Midterms are not anything like lecture or the psets. Khan Academy is your most reliable resource.	MATH-51
2	It's a hard class and requires a lot of time and effort to understand the material.	MATH-51
2	This course is very fast paced. Stay on top of the readings and assignments, and use office hours early on.	MATH-51
2	I think this is an extremely difficult course, but it is rewarding to learn and is extremely important for many majors.	MATH-51
2	Take it with Jinyoung she is the best!	MATH-51
2	The next step for math. It's a difficult class, but gives you a strong grasp of very applicable and important math across a variety of disciplines and fields.	MATH-51
2	Really hard class. I really loved my instructor, Jinyoung Park, and felt like I understood the content. But the exams were difficult, and the grading weighs the exams heavily. If you're taking the class, make sure to actually do the readings (they're long but worth it if you really want to understand the material and certain parts are very skim-able/skippable), attend section (good opportunity to ask questions cause sometimes the book is too dense), and start the psets early (nothing more to be said, they're really long and sometimes really hard so cramming isn't the way to go). The one thing that's really good is that the homework is more or less reflective of the difficulty of the tests (the tests are a harder but not by much compared to some other classes). So with that said, always try the pset on your own before working with others. A lot of people have perfect scores on homework but do really poorly on the tests. Trying the homework on your own at first can help you get a read for how well you understand everything.	MATH-51
2	This class is definitely challenging. There is a lot of content so it is important to stay on track with the readings and ATTEND LECTURE. The lectures were the most valuable aspect of the course. The textbook contains a lot of extra information and can be confusing. Jinyoung Park was an amazing lecturer.	MATH-51
2	Very simple course if you put in the effort and understand	MATH-51
2	This class is HARD. The midterms are not like the homework, class problems, or practice midterms. This class prides itself off pitting students against each other and encouraging them to fail. This class severely harmed my mental health. The worst part is that this class is a pre-req or requirement for like every single major, you would think they would be super accommodating and helpful, however they are not. None of my accommodations were met, and this class just does not care about the students in it. There are literally students that fail midterms but understand the material. This class does not accurately determine a student's knowledge. If by some miracle you do not have to take this class, then don't. If you are considering CME 100 or Math 51 take CME 100.	MATH-51
2	The class provides a really strong and interesting foundation in linear algebra (from matrix operations to eigenvalues/eigenvectors and Hessians) and multivariable calculus (mainly partial derivatives) - it is a time commitment and requires dedication, but is also extremely rewarding!	MATH-51
2	Math 51 is a weeder class for STEM students. It is uncomfortably fast-paced, has very difficult to understand concepts, instructors who talk very fast to cover lots of material but do little explaining and a DENSE, hard to understand textbook that explains things more with variables and conceptually with big words without relating it in a way that makes sense to a 'not math person'. Taking this class is going to suck. If it was not required for almost every STEM major, it would rarely be taken. However, it is there and you will take it regardless. Think of it more as a right of passage than a class that you may enjoy and actually do well in.	MATH-51
2	Great class!	MATH-51
2	It's a challenging course not so much because the material itself it hard but because the midterms and exams are a bit unfair in terms of what they ask. If you put in the work and the time the reading, lectures, and material as a whole is not so bad but some questions on exams can be very confusing and unfair.	MATH-51
2	Don't take it, do stats instead.	MATH-51
